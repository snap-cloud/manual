<p><strong>[W]{.smallcaps}</strong>e have been extremely lucky in our mentors. Jens cut
his teeth in the company of the Smalltalk pioneers: Alan Kay, Dan
Ingalls, and the rest of the gang who invented personal computing and
object oriented programming in the great days of Xerox PARC. He worked
with John Maloney, of the MIT Scratch Team, who developed the Morphic
graphics framework that’s still at the heart of Snap<em>!</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>The brilliant design of Scratch, from the Lifelong Kindergarten Group
at the MIT Media Lab, is crucial to</em> Snap<em>!. Our earlier version, BYOB,
was a direct modification of the Scratch source code.</em> Snap<em>! is a
complete rewrite, but its code structure and its user interface remain
deeply indebted to Scratch. And the Scratch Team, who could have seen us
as rivals, have been entirely supportive and welcoming to us.</em></strong></p>

<p>Brian grew up at the MIT and Stanford Artificial Intelligence Labs,
learning from Lisp inventor John McCarthy, Scheme inventors Gerald J.
Sussman and Guy Steele, and the authors of the world’s best computer
science book, <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,</em> Hal
Abelson and Gerald J. Sussman with Julie Sussman, among many other
heroes of computer science. (Brian was also lucky enough, while in high
school, to meet Kenneth Iverson, the inventor of APL.)</p>

<p><strong><em>In the glory days of the MIT Logo Lab, we used to say, “Logo is Lisp
disguised as BASIC.” Now, with its first class procedures, lexical
scope, and first class continuations,</em> Snap<em>! is Scheme disguised as
Scratch.</em></strong></p>

<p>Four people have made such massive contributions to the implementation
of Snap<em>!</em> that we have officially declared them members of the team:
Michael Ball and Bernat Romagosa, in addition to contributions
throughout the project, have primary responsibility for the web site and
cloud storage. Joan Guillén i Pelegay has contributed very careful and
wise analysis of outstanding issues, including help in taming the
management of translations to non-English languages. Jadga Hügle, has
energetically contributed to online mini-courses about Snap<em>!</em> and
leading workshops for kids and for adults. Jens, Jadga, and Bernat are
paid to work on Snap<em>!</em> by SAP, which also supports our computing needs.</p>

<p>We have been fortunate to get to know an amazing group of brilliant
middle school(!) and high school students through the Scratch Advanced
Topics forum, several of whom (since grown up) have contributed code to
Snap<em>!</em>: Kartik Chandra, Nathan Dinsmore, Connor Hudson, Ian Reynolds,
and Deborah Servilla. Many more have contributed ideas and alpha-testing
bug reports. UC Berkeley students who’ve contributed code include Achal
Dave. Kyle Hotchkiss, Ivan Motyashov, and Yuan Yuan. Contributors of
translations are too numerous to list here, but they’re in the
“About…” box in Snap<em>!</em> itself.</p>

<p><strong>Version 8.0</strong></p>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> (formerly BYOB) is an extended reimplementation of Scratch
([http://scratch.mit.edu]{.underline}) that allows you to Build Your Own
Blocks. It also features ﬁrst class lists, ﬁrst class procedures, first
class sprites, first class costumes, first class sounds, and first class
continuations. These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious
introduction to computer science for high school or college students.</p>

<p>In this manual we sometimes make reference to Scratch, e.g., to explain
how some Snap<em>!</em> feature extends something familiar in Scratch. It’s
very helpful to have some experience with Scratch before reading this
manual, but not essential.</p>

<p>To run Snap<em>!</em>[,]{.smallcaps} open a browser window and connect to
http://snap.berkeley.edu/run. The Snap<em>!</em> community web site at
http://snap.berkeley.edu is not part of this manual’s scope.</p>

<h1 id="blocks-scripts-and-sprites">Blocks, Scripts, and Sprites</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the Snap<em>!</em> features inherited from Scratch;
experienced Scratch users can skip to Section B.</p>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> is a programming language—a notation in which you can tell a
computer what you want it to do. Unlike most programming languages,
though, Snap<em>!</em> is a <em>visual</em> language; instead of writing a program
using the keyboard, the Snap<em>!</em> programmer uses the same drag-and-drop
interface familiar to computer users.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image5.png" alt="" />{width=”4.326388888888889in”
height=”2.689583333333333in”}Start Snap<em>!</em>[.]{.smallcaps} You should see
the following arrangement of regions in the window:</p>

<p>(The proportions of these areas may be different, depending on the size
and shape of your browser window.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image6.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4791666666666667in”
height=”1.3541666666666667in”}A Snap<em>!</em> program consists of one or more
<em>scripts,</em> each of which is made of <em>blocks.</em> Here’s a typical script:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image7.png" alt="" />{width=”2.2465277777777777in”
height=”1.4694444444444446in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image8.png" alt="" />{width=”2.2083333333333335in”
height=”1.1388888888888888in”}The five blocks that make up this script
have three different colors, corresponding to three of the eight
<em>palettes</em> in which blocks can be found. The palette area at the left
edge of the window shows one palette at a time, chosen with the eight
buttons just above the palette area. In this script, the gold blocks are
from the Control palette; the green block is from the Pen palette; and
the blue blocks are from the Motion palette. A script is assembled by
dragging blocks from a palette into the <em>scripting area</em> in the middle
part of the window. Blocks snap together (hence the name Snap<em>!</em> for the
language) when you drag a block so that its indentation is near the tab
of the one above it:</p>

<p>The white horizontal line is a signal that if you let go of the green
block it will snap into the tab of the gold one.</p>

<h3 id="hat-blocks-and-command-blocks-hat-blocks-and-command-blocks-listparagraph">Hat Blocks and Command Blocks {#hat-blocks-and-command-blocks .ListParagraph}</h3>

<p>At the top of the script is a <em>hat</em> block, which indicates when the
script should be carried out. Hat block names typically start with the
word “when”; in the square-drawing example on page 5, the script should
be run when the green flag near the right end of the Snap<em>!</em> tool bar is
clicked. (The Snap<em>!</em> tool bar is part of the Snap<em>!</em> window, not the
same as the browser’s or operating system’s menu bar.) A script isn’t
required to have a hat block, but if not, then the script will be run
only if the user clicks on the script itself. A script can’t have more
than one hat block, and the hat block can be used only at the top of the
script; its distinctive shape is meant to remind you of that.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image9.png" alt="" />{width=”1.1666666666666667in”
height=”0.25in”}The other blocks in our example script are <em>command</em>
blocks. Each command block corresponds to an action that Snap<em>!</em> already
knows how to carry out. For example, the block tells the sprite (the
arrowhead shape on the <em>stage</em> at the right end of the window) to move
ten steps (a step is a very small unit of distance) in the direction in
which the arrowhead is pointing. We’ll see shortly that there can be
more than one sprite, and that each sprite has its own scripts. Also, a
sprite doesn’t have to look like an arrowhead, but can have any picture
as a <em>costume.</em> The shape of the move block is meant to remind you of a
Lego™ brick; a script is a stack of blocks. (The word “block” denotes
both the graphical shape on the screen and the procedure, the action,
that the block carries out.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image10.png" alt="" />{width=”1.0972222222222223in”
height=”0.3541666666666667in”}The number 10 in the move block above is
called an <em>input</em> to the block. By clicking on the white oval, you can
type any number in place of the 10. The sample script on the previous
page uses 100 as the input value. We’ll see later that inputs can have
non-oval shapes that accept values other than numbers. We’ll also see
that you can compute input values, instead of typing a particular value
into the oval. A block can have more than one input slot. For example,
the glide block located about halfway down the Motion palette has three
inputs.</p>

<p>Most command blocks have that brick shape, but some, like the repeat
block in the sample script, are <em>C‑shaped.</em> Most C-shaped blocks are
found in the Control palette. The slot inside the C shape is a special
kind of input slot that accepts a <em>script</em> as the input.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image6.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4791666666666667in”
height=”1.3541666666666667in”}</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image11.png" alt="" />{width=”1.40625in”
height=”0.4895833333333333in”}In the sample script</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image12.png" alt="" />{width=”5.697916666666667in”
height=”1.445138888888889in”}C-shaped blocks can be put in a script in
two ways. If you see a white line and let go, the block will be inserted
into the script like any command block:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image16.png" alt="" />{width=”5.501388888888889in”
height=”1.2777777777777777in”}But if you see an orange halo and let go,
the block will <em>wrap</em> around the haloed blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image20.png" alt="" />{width=”5.800694444444445in”
height=”1.2916666666666667in”}The halo will always extend from the
cursor position to the bottom of the script:</p>

<p>If you want only some of those blocks, after wrapping you can grab the
first block you don’t want wrapped, pull it down, and snap it under the
C-shaped block.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image24.png" alt="" />{width=”2.311111111111111in”
height=”1.3666666666666667in”}For “E-shaped” blocks with more than one
C-shaped slot, only the first slot will wrap around existing blocks in a
script, and only if that C-shaped slot is empty before wrapping. (You
can fill the other slots by dragging blocks into the desired slot.)</p>

<h2 id="width03402777777777778in-height024305555555555555insprites-and-parallelism"><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image25.png" alt="" />{width=”0.3402777777777778in” height=”0.24305555555555555in”}Sprites and Parallelism</h2>

<p>Just below the stage is the “new sprite” button . Click the button to
add a new sprite to the stage. The new sprite will appear in a random
position on the stage, with a random color, but always facing to the
right.</p>

<p>Each sprite has its own scripts. To see the scripts for a particular
sprite in the scripting area, click on the picture of that sprite in the
<em>sprite corral</em> in the bottom right corner of the window. Try putting
one of the following scripts in each sprite’s scripting area:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image26.png" alt="" />{width=”1.5506944444444444in”
height=”0.99375in”}
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image27.png" alt="" />{width=”1.5416666666666667in”
height=”1.1666666666666667in”}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you click the green flag, you should see one sprite rotate while
the other moves back and forth. This experiment illustrates the way
different scripts can run in parallel. The turning and the moving happen
together. Parallelism can be seen with multiple scripts of a single
sprite also. Try this example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image28.png" alt="" />{width=”1.7291666666666667in”
height=”0.875in”}
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image29.png" alt="" />{width=”1.7291666666666667in”
height=”0.8958333333333334in”}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you press the space key, the sprite should move forever in a
circle, because the move and turn blocks are run in parallel. (To stop
the program, click the red stop sign at the right end of the tool bar.)</p>

<h3 id="costumes-and-sounds">Costumes and Sounds</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image30.png" alt="" />{width=”0.3194444444444444in”
height=”0.2152777777777778in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image31.png" alt="" />{width=”1.7666666666666666in”
height=”1.875in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image32.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”
height=”0.16666666666666666in”}To change the appearance of a sprite,
paint or import a new <em>costume</em> for it. To paint a costume, click on the
Costumes tab above the scripting area, and click the paint button . The
<em>Paint Editor</em> that appears is explained on page 128. There are three
ways to import a costume. First select the desired sprite in the sprite
corral. Then, one way is to click on the file icon in the tool bar ,
then choose the “Costumes…“menu item. You will see a list of costumes
from the public media library, and can choose one. The second way, for a
costume stored on your own computer, is to click on the file icon and
choose the “Import…” menu item. You can then select a file in any
picture format (PNG, JPEG, etc.) supported by your browser. The third
way is quicker if the file you want is visible on the desktop: Just drag
the file onto the Snap<em>!</em> window. In any of these cases, the scripting
area will be replaced by something like this:</p>

<p>Just above this part of the window is a set of three tabs: Scripts,
Costumes, and Sounds. You’ll see that the Costumes tab is now selected.
In this view, the sprite’s <em>wardrobe,</em> you can choose whether the sprite
should wear its Turtle costume or its Alonzo costume. (Alonzo, the
Snap<em>!</em> mascot, is named after Alonzo Church, a mathematician who
invented the idea of procedures as data, the most important way in which
Snap<em>!</em> is different from Scratch.) You can give a sprite as many
costumes as you like, and then choose which it will wear either by
clicking in its wardrobe or by using the or block in a script. (Every
costume has a number as well as a name. The next costume block selects
the next costume by number; after the highest-numbered costume it
switches to costume 1. The Turtle, costume 0, is never chosen by next
costume.) The Turtle costume is the only one that changes color to match
a change in the sprite’s pen color. Protip: switches to the <em>previous</em>
costume, wrapping like next costume.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image33.png" alt="" />{width=”1.8055555555555556in”
height=”0.2777777777777778in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image34.png" alt="" />{width=”2.9493055555555556in”
height=”0.2604166666666667in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image38.png" alt="" />{width=”1.8958333333333333in”
height=”0.2604166666666667in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image39.png" alt="" />{width=”1.2395833333333333in”
height=”0.2604166666666667in”}In addition to its costumes, a sprite can
have <em>sounds;</em> the equivalent for sounds of the sprite’s wardrobe is
called its <em>jukebox.</em> Sound files can be imported in any format (WAV,
OGG, MP3, etc.) supported by your browser. <em>Two blocks accomplish the
task of playing sounds. If you would like a script to continue running
while the sound is playing, use the block . In contrast, you can use the
block to wait for the sound's completion before continuing the rest of
the script.</em></p>

<h3 id="inter-sprite-communication-with-broadcast">Inter-Sprite Communication with Broadcast</h3>

<p>Earlier we saw an example of two sprites moving at the same time. In a
more interesting program, though, the sprites on stage will <em>interact</em>
to tell a story, play a game, etc. Often one sprite will have to tell
another sprite to run a script. Here’s a simple example:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image40.png" alt="" />{width=”1.71875in”
height=”0.24938648293963256in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image41.png" alt="" />{width=”0.5694444444444444in”

height=”0.19166666666666668in”}In the block, the word “bark” is just an
arbitrary name I made up. When you click on the downward arrowhead in
that input slot, one of the choices (the only choice, the first time) is
“new,” which then prompts you to enter a name for the new broadcast.
When this block is run, the chosen message is sent to <em>every</em> sprite,
which is why the block is called “broadcast.” (But if you click the
right arrow after the message name, the block becomes , and you can
change it to  to send the message just to one sprite.) In this program,
though, only one sprite has a script to run when that broadcast is sent,
namely the dog. Because the boy’s script uses broadcast and wait rather
than just broadcast, the boy doesn’t go on to his next say block until
the dog’s script finishes. That’s why the two sprites take turns
talking, instead of both talking at once. In Chapter VII,
“Object-Oriented Programming with Sprites,” you’ll see a more flexible
way to send a message to a specific sprite using the tell and ask
blocks.</p>

<p>Notice, by the way, that the say block’s first input slot is rectangular
rather than oval. This means the input can be any text string, not only
a number. In text input slots, a space character is shown as a brown
dot, so that you can count the number of spaces between words, and in
particular you can tell the difference between an empty slot and one
containing spaces. The brown dots are <em>not</em> shown on the stage if the
text is displayed.</p>

<p>The stage has its own scripting area. It can be selected by clicking on
the Stage icon at the left of the sprite corral. Unlike a sprite,
though, the stage can’t move. Instead of costumes, it has <em>backgrounds:</em>
pictures that fill the entire stage area. The sprites appear in front of
the current background. In a complicated project, it’s often convenient
to use a script in the stage’s scripting area as the overall director of
the action.</p>

<h2 id="nesting-sprites-anchors-and-parts">Nesting Sprites: Anchors and Parts</h2>

<p>Sometimes it’s desirable to make a sort of “super-sprite” composed of
pieces that can move together but can also be separately articulated.
The classic example is a person’s body made up of a torso, limbs, and a
head. Snap<em>!</em> allows one sprite to be designated as the <em>anchor</em> of the
combined shape, with other sprites as its <em>parts.</em> To set up sprite
nesting, drag the sprite corral icon of a <em>part</em> sprite onto the stage
display (not the sprite corral icon!) of the desired <em>anchor</em> sprite.
The precise place where you let go of the mouse button will be the
attachment point of the part on the anchor.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image47.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6305555555555555in”
height=”0.9652777777777778in”}Sprite nesting is shown in the sprite
corral icons of both anchors and parts:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image48.png" alt="" />{width=”4.875694444444444in”

height=”0.8333333333333334in”}In this illustration, it is desired to
animate Alonzo’s arm. (The arm has been colored green in this picture to
make the relationship of the two sprites clearer, but in a real project
they’d be the same color, probably.) Sprite, representing Alonzo’s body,
is the anchor; Sprite(2) is the arm. The icon for the anchor shows small
images of up to three attached parts at the bottom. The icon for each
part shows a small image of the anchor in its top left corner, and a
<em>synchronous/dangling rotation flag</em> in the top right corner. In its
initial, synchronous setting, as shown above, it means that the when the
anchor sprite rotates, the part sprite also rotates as well as revolving
around the anchor. When clicked, it changes from a circular arrow to a
straight arrow, and indicates that when the anchor sprite rotates, the
part sprite revolves around it, but does not rotate, keeping its
original orientation. (The part can also be rotated separately, using
its turn blocks.) Any change in the position or size of the anchor is
always extended to its parts. Also, cloning the anchor (see Section VII.
B) will also clone all its parts.</p>

<p><em>Top: turning the part: the green arm. Bottom: turning the anchor, with
the arm synchronous (left) and dangling (right).</em></p>

<h2 id="reporter-blocks-and-expressions">Reporter Blocks and Expressions</h2>

height=”0.15625in”}So far, we’ve used two kinds of blocks: hat blocks
and command blocks. Another kind is the <em>reporter</em> block, which has an
oval shape: . It’s called a “reporter” because when it’s run, instead of
carrying out an action, it reports a value that can be used as an input
to another block. If you drag a reporter into the scripting area by
itself and click on it, the value it reports will appear in a speech
balloon next to the block:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image67.png" alt="" />{width=”5.312752624671916in”
height=”0.9583333333333334in”}When you drag a reporter block over
another block’s input slot, a white “halo” appears around that input
slot, analogous to the white line that appears when snapping command
blocks together:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image71.png" alt="" />{width=”2.111111111111111in”
height=”0.6180555555555556in”}Don’t drop the input over a <em>red</em> halo:</p>

<p>That’s used for a purpose explained on page 68.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple script that uses a reporter block:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image72.png" alt="" />{width=”5.319444444444445in”
height=”1.3645833333333333in”}Here the x position reporter provides the
first input to the say block. (The sprite’s X position is its horizontal
position, how far left (negative values) or right (positive values) it
is compared to the center of the stage. Similarly, the Y position is
measured vertically, in steps above (positive) or below (negative) the
center.)</p>

<p>You can do arithmetic using reporters in the Operators palette:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image76.png" alt="" />{width=”6.263888888888889in”
height=”1.4479166666666667in”}The round block rounds 35.3905… to 35,
and the + block adds 100 to that. (By the way, the round block is in the
Operators palette, just like +, but in this script it’s a lighter color
with black lettering because Snap<em>!</em> alternates light and dark versions
of the palette colors when a block is nested inside another block from
the same palette:</p>

height=”0.23958333333333334in”}This aid to readability is called <em>zebra
coloring.</em>) A reporter block with its inputs, maybe including other
reporter blocks, such as , is called an <em>expression.</em></p>

<h2 id="predicates-and-conditional-evaluation">Predicates and Conditional Evaluation</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image82.png" alt="" />{width=”0.6666666666666666in”

height=”0.1875in”}Most reporters report either a number, like , or a
text string, like . A <em>predicate</em> is a special kind of reporter that
always reports true or false. Predicates have a hexagonal shape:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image84.png" alt="" />{width=”1.9479166666666667in”
height=”0.2604166666666667in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image85.png" alt="" />{width=”1.0729166666666667in”
height=”0.15625in”}The special shape is a reminder that predicates don’t
generally make sense in an input slot of blocks that are expecting a
number or text. You wouldn’t say , although (as you can see from the
picture) Snap<em>!</em> lets you do it if you really want. Instead, you
normally use predicates in special hexagonal input slots like this one:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image86.png" alt="" />{width=”0.6666666666666666in”
height=”0.5694444444444444in”}The C-shaped if block runs its input
script if (and only if) the expression in its hexagonal input reports
true.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image87.png" alt="" />{width=”1.59375in”
height=”0.6145833333333334in”}A really useful block in animations runs
its input script <em>repeatedly</em> until a predicate is satisfied:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image88.png" alt="" />{width=”2.2819444444444446in”

height=”0.84375in”}If, while working on a project, you want to omit
temporarily some commands in a script, but you don’t want to forget
where they belong, you can say</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to take the same action whether some condition is
true or false, but with a different input value. For this purpose you
can use the <em>reporter</em> if block:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image90.png" alt="" />{width=”4.208333333333333in”
height=”0.3854166666666667in”}The technical term for a true or false
value is a “Boolean” value; it has a capital B because it’s named after
a person, George Boole, who developed the mathematical theory of Boolean
values. Don’t get confused; a hexagonal block is a <em>predicate,</em> but the
value it reports is a <em>Boolean.</em></p>

<p>Another quibble about vocabulary: Many programming languages reserve the
name “procedure” for Commands (that carry out an action) and use the
name “function” for Reporters and Predicates. In this manual, a
<em>procedure</em> is any computational capability, including those that report
values and those that don’t. Commands, Reporters, and Predicates are all
procedures. The words “a Procedure type” are shorthand for “Command
type, Reporter type, or Predicate type.”</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image91.png" alt="" />{width=”1.375in”

value in a hexagonal slot instead of a predicate-based expression, hover
the mouse over the block and click on the control that appears:</p>

<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image93.png" alt="" />{width=”1.5833333333333333in”
height=”1.4166666666666667in”}Try this script:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image94.png" alt="" />{width=”1.8854166666666667in”
height=”1.4375in”}The input to the move block is an orange oval. To get
it there, drag the orange oval that’s part of the for block:</p>

<p>The orange oval is a <em>variable:</em> a symbol that represents a value. (I
took this screenshot before changing the second number input to the for
block from the default 10 to 200, and before dragging in a turn block.)
For runs its script input repeatedly, just like repeat, but before each
repetition it sets the variable i to a number starting with its first
numeric input, adding 1 for each repetition, until it reaches the second
numeric input. In this case, there will be 200 repetitions, first with
i=1, then with i=2, then 3, and so on until i=200 for the final
repetition. The result is that each move draws a longer and longer line
segment, and that’s why the picture you see is a kind of spiral. (If you
try again with a turn of 90 degrees instead of 92, you’ll see why this
picture is called a “squiral.”)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image95.png" alt="" />{width=”3.1875in”
height=”1.5in”}The variable i is created by the for block, and it can
only be used in the script inside the block’s C-slot. (By the way, if
you don’t like the name i, you can change it by clicking on the orange
oval without dragging it, which will pop up a dialog window in which you
can enter a different name:</p>

<p>“I” isn’t a very descriptive name; you might prefer “length” to indicate
its purpose in the script. “I” is traditional because mathematicians
tend to use letters between i and n to represent integer values, but in
programming languages we don’t have to restrict ourselves to
single-letter variable names.)</p>

<h3 id="global-variables">Global Variables</h3>

<p>You can create variables “by hand” that aren’t limited to being used
within a single block. At the top of the Variables palette, click the
“Make a variable” button:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image96.png" alt="" />{width=”3.1875in”
height=”1.84375in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image97.png" alt="" />{width=”2.0520833333333335in”
height=”2.2708333333333335in”}This will bring up a dialog window in
which you can give your variable a name:</p>

<p>The dialog also gives you a choice to make the variable available to all
sprites (which is almost always what you want) or to make it visible
only in the current sprite. You’d do that if you’re going to give
several sprites individual variables <em>with the same name,</em> so that you
can share a script between sprites (by dragging it from the current
sprite’s scripting area to the picture of another sprite in the sprite
corral), and the different sprites will do slightly different things
when running that script because each has a different value for that
variable name.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image98.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6583333333333334in”
height=”2.2916666666666665in”}If you give your variable the name “name”
then the Variables palette will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image99.png" alt="" />{width=”1.0416666666666667in”
height=”0.40625in”}There’s now a “Delete a variable” button, and there’s
an orange oval with the variable name in it, just like the orange oval
in the for block. You can drag the variable into any script in the
scripting area. Next to the oval is a checkbox, initially checked. When
it’s checked, you’ll also see a <em>variable watcher</em> on the stage:</p>

<p>When you give the variable a value, the orange box in its watcher will
display the value.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image100.png" alt="" />{width=”1.9270833333333333in”
height=”0.4791666666666667in”}How <em>do</em> you give it a value? You use the
set block:</p>

<p>Note that you <em>don’t</em> drag the variable’s oval into the set block! You
click on the downarrow in the first input slot, and you get a menu of
all the available variable names.</p>

<p>If you do choose “For this sprite only” when creating a variable, its
block in the palette looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image101.png" alt="Macintosh

height=”0.14166666666666666in”} The <em>location</em>-pin icon is a bit of a
pun on a sprite-<em>local</em> variable. It’s shown only in the palette.</p>

height=”2.3125in”}In the name example above, our project is going to
carry on an interaction with the user, and we want to remember their
name throughout the project. That’s a good example of a situation in
which a <em>global</em> variable (the kind you make with the “Make a variable”
button) is appropriate. Another common example is a variable called
“score” in a game project. But sometimes you only need a variable
temporarily, during the running of a particular script. In that case you
can use the script variables block to make the variable:</p>

<p>As in the for block, you can click on an orange oval in the script
variables block without dragging to change its name. You can also make
more than one temporary variable by clicking on the right arrow at the
end of the block to add another variable oval:</p>

<h3 id="width20833333333333335in-height03020833333333333inrenaming-variables"><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image106.png" alt="" />{width=”2.0833333333333335in” height=”0.3020833333333333in”}Renaming variables</h3>

<p>There are several reasons why you might want to change the name of a
variable:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It has a default name, such as the “a” in script variables or the
“i” in for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It conflicts with another name, such as a global variable, that you
want to use in the same script.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You just decide a different name would be more self-documenting.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the first and third case, you probably want to change the name
everywhere it appears in that script, or even in all scripts. In the
second case, if you’ve already used both variables in the script before
realizing that they have the same name, you’ll want to look at each
instance separately to decide which ones to rename. Both of these
operations are possible by right-clicking or control-clicking on a
variable oval.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image107.png" alt="" />{width=”1.613888888888889in”

height=”0.7430555555555556in”}If you right-click on an orange oval in a
context in which the variable is <em>used,</em> then you are able to rename
just that one orange oval:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image110.png" alt="" />{width=”1.7083333333333333in”
height=”0.8333333333333334in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image111.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4930555555555556in”
height=”0.7430555555555556in”}If you right-click on the place where the
variable is <em>defined</em> (a script variables block, the orange oval for a
global variable in the Variables palette, or an orange oval that’s built
into a block such as the “i” in for), then you are given two renaming
options, “rename” and “rename all.” If you choose “rename,” then the
name is changed only in that one orange oval, as in the previous case:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image112.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4930555555555556in”

height=”0.8333333333333334in”}But if you choose “rename all,” then the
name will be changed throughout the scope of the variable (the script
for a script variable, or everywhere for a global variable):</p>

<h3 id="transient-variables">Transient variables</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image114.png" alt="" />{width=”1.2916666666666667in”
height=”1.0555555555555556in”}So far we’ve talked about variables with
numeric values, or with short text strings such as someone’s name. But
there’s no limit to the amount of information you can put in a variable;
in Chapter IV you’ll see how to use <em>lists</em> to collect many values in
one data structure, and in Chapter VIII you’ll see how to read
information from web sites. When you use these capabilities, your
project may take up a lot of memory in the computer. If you get close to
the amount of memory available to Snap<em>!</em>, then it may become impossible
to save your project. (Extra space is needed temporarily to convert from
Snap<em>!</em> ‘s internal representation to the form in which projects are
exported or saved.) If your program reads a lot of data from the outside
world that will still be available when you use it next, you might want
to have values containing a lot of data removed from memory before
saving the project. To do this, right-click or control-click on the
orange oval in the Variables palette, to see this menu:</p>

<p>You already know about the rename options, and help… displays a help
screen about variables in general. Here we’re interested in the check
box next to transient. If you check it, this variable’s value will not
be saved when you save your project. Of course, you’ll have to ensure
that when your project is loaded, it recreates the needed value and sets
the variable to it.</p>

<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> provides several tools to help you debug a program. They center
around the idea of <em>pausing</em> the running of a script partway through, so
that you can examine the values of variables.</p>

<h3 id="the-pause-button">The pause button</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image115.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”
height=”0.16666666666666666in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image116.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”
height=”0.16666666666666666in”}The simplest way to pause a program is
manually, by clicking the pause button in the top right corner of the
window. While the program is paused, you can run other scripts by
clicking on them, show variables on stage with the checkbox next to the
variable in the Variables palette or with the show variable block, and
do all the other things you can generally do, including modifying the
paused scripts by adding or removing blocks. The button changes shape to
and clicking it again resumes the paused scripts.</p>

<h3 id="breakpoints-the-pause-all-block">Breakpoints: the pause all block</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image117.png" alt="" />{width=”0.8194444444444444in”
height=”0.2152777777777778in”}The pause button is great if your program
seems to be in an infinite loop, but more often you’ll want to set a
<em>breakpoint,</em> a particular point in a script at which you want to pause.
The block, near the bottom of the Control palette, can be inserted in a
script to pause when it is run. So, for example, if your program is
getting an error message in a particular block, you could use pause all
just before that block to look at the values of variables just before
the error happens.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image118.png" alt="" />{width=”1.8833333333333333in”
height=”0.9111111111111111in”}The pause all block turns bright cyan
while paused. Also, during the pause, you can right-click on a running
script and the menu that appears will give you the option to show
watchers for temporary variables of the script:</p>

<p>But what if the block with the error is run many times in a loop, and it
only errors when a particular condition is true—say, the value of some
variable is negative, which shouldn’t ever happen. In the iteration
library (see page 25 for more about how to use libraries) is a
breakpoint block that lets you set a <em>conditional</em> breakpoint, and
automatically display the relevant variables before pausing. Here’s a
sample use of it:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image119.png" alt="" />{width=”1.1944444444444444in”
height=”1.3333333333333333in”}(In this contrived example, variable zot
comes from outside the script but is relevant to its behavior.) When you
continue (with the pause button), the temporary variable watchers are
removed by this breakpoint block before resuming the script. The
breakpoint block isn’t magic; you could alternatively just put a pause
all inside an if.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

height=”0.16666666666666666in”}Sometimes you’re not exactly sure where
the error is, or you don’t understand how the program got there. To
understand better, you’d like to watch the program as it runs, at human
speed rather than at computer speed. You can do this by clicking the
<em>visible stepping button</em> ( ), before running a script or while the
script is paused. The button will light up ( ) and a speed control
slider will appear in the toolbar. When you start or continue the
script, its blocks and input slots will light up cyan one at a time:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image124.png" alt="" />{width=”7.498611111111111in”
height=”1.15in”}In this simple example, the inputs to the blocks are
constant values, but if an input were a more complicated expression
involving several reporter blocks, each of those would light up as they
are called. Note that the input to a block is evaluated before the block
itself is called, so, for example, the 100 lights up before the move.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image134.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”
height=”0.16666666666666666in”}The speed of stepping is controlled by
the slider. If you move the slider all the way to the left, the speed is
zero, the pause button turns into a step button , and the script takes a
single step each time you push it. The name for this is <em>single
stepping.</em></p>

<p>If several scripts that are visible in the scripting area are running at
the same time, all of them are stepped in parallel. However, consider
the case of two repeat loops with different numbers of blocks. While not
stepping, each script goes through a complete cycle of its loop in each
display cycle, despite the difference in the length of a cycle. In order
to ensure that the visible result of a program on the stage is the same
when stepped as when not stepped, the shorter script will wait at the
bottom of its loop for the longer script to catch up.</p>

<p>When we talk about custom blocks in Chapter III, we’ll have more to say
about visible stepping as it affects those blocks.</p>

<h2 id="etcetera">Etcetera</h2>

<p>This manual doesn’t explain every block in detail. There are many more
motion blocks, sound blocks, costume and graphics effects blocks, and so
on. You can learn what they all do by experimentation, and also by
reading the “help screens” that you can get by right-clicking or
control-clicking a block and selecting “help…” from the menu that
appears. If you forget what palette (color) a block is, but you remember
at least part of its name, type control-F and enter the name in the text
block that appears in the palette area.</p>

<p>Here are the primitive blocks that don’t exist in Scratch:</p>

height=”0.22916666666666666in”} reports a new costume consisting of
everything that’s drawn on the stage by any sprite. Right-clicking the
block in the scripting area gives the option to change it to if vector
logging is enabled. See page 116.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image137.png" alt="" />{width=”2.0833333333333335in”
height=”0.375in”}Print characters in the given point size on the stage,
at the sprite’s position and in its direction. The sprite moves to the
end of the text. (That’s not always what you want, but you can save the
sprite’s position before using it, and sometimes you need to know how
big the text turned out to be, in turtle steps.) If the pen is down, the
text will be underlined.</p>

height=”0.5138888888888888in”}Takes a sprite as input. Like stamp except
that the costume is stamped onto the selected sprite instead of onto the
stage. (Does nothing if the current sprite doesn’t overlap the chosen
sprite.)</p>

height=”1.5756944444444445in”}The at block lets you examine the screen
pixel directly behind the rotation center of a sprite, the mouse, or an
arbitrary (x,y) coordinate pair dropped onto the second menu slot. The
first five items of the left menu let you examine the color visible at
the position. (The “RGBA” option reports a list.) The “sprites” option
reports a list of all sprites, including this one, any point of which
overlaps this sprite’s rotation center (behind or in front). This is a
hyperblock with respect to its second input.</p>

height=”2.23125in”}Turn the text into a list, using the second input as
the delimiter between items. The default delimiter, indicated by the
brown dot in the input slot, is a single space character. “Letter” puts
each character of the text in its own list item. “Word” puts each word
in an item. (Words are separated by any number of consecutive space,
tab, carriage return, or newline characters.) “Line” is a newline
character (0xa); “tab” is a tab character (0x9); “cr” is a carriage
return (0xd). “Csv” and “json” split formatted text into lists of lists;
see page 54. “Blocks” takes a script as the first input, reporting a
list structure representing the structure of the script. See Chapter XI.</p>

height=”0.18958333333333333in”}For lists, reports true only if its two
input values are the very same list, so changing an item in one of them
is visible in the other. (For =, lists that look the same are the same.)
For text strings, uses case-sensitive comparison, unlike =, which is
case-independent.</p>

the relabel option of any dyadic arithmetic block. They’re hidden partly
because writing them in Snap<em>!</em> is a good, pretty easy programming
exercise. Note: the two inputs to atan2 are Δ<em>x</em> and Δ<em>y</em> in that order,
because we measure angles clockwise from north. Max and min are
<em>variadic;</em> by clicking the arrowhead, you can provide additional
inputs.</p>

page</strong> <strong>101)</strong></p>

<p>These blocks support <em>metaprogramming,</em> which means manipulating blocks
and scripts as data. This is not the same as manipulating procedures
(see Chapter VI. ), which are what the blocks <em>mean;</em> in metaprogramming
the actual blocks, what you see on the screen, are the data. This
capability is new in version 8.0.</p>

<p><strong>Scenes:</strong></p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image280.png" alt="" />{width=”2.38in”
height=”1.32in”}The major new feature of version 7.0 is <em>scenes:</em> A
project can include within it sub-projects, called scenes, each with its
own stage, sprites, scripts, and so on. This block makes another scene
active, replacing the current one.</p>

<p>Nothing is automatically shared between scenes: no sprites, no blocks,
no variables. But the old scene can send a message to the new one, to
start it running, with optional payload as in broadcast (page 23).</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image281.png" alt="" />{width=”2.54in”

</blockquote>

<p><strong><br />
These aren’t new blocks but they have a new feature:</strong></p>

<p>These accept two-item (x,y) lists as input, and have extended menus
(also including other sprites):</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image286.png" alt="" />{width=”7.483252405949257in”
height=”1.1298611111111112in”}”Center” means the center of the stage,
the point at (0,0). “Direction” is in the point in direction sense, the
direction that would leave this sprite pointing toward another sprite,
the mouse, or the center. “Ray length” is the distance from the center
of this sprite to the nearest point on the other sprite, in the current
direction.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image296.png" alt="" />{width=”2.571527777777778in”
height=”1.41875in”}The stop block has two extra menu choices. Stop this
block is used inside the definition of a custom block to stop just this
invocation of this custom block and continue the script that called it.
Stop all but this script is good at the end of a game to stop all the
game pieces from moving around, but keep running this script to provide
the user’s final score. The last two menu choices add a tab at the
bottom of the block because the current script can continue after it.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image300.png" alt="" />{width=”2.4125in”
height=”1.0659722222222223in”}The new “pen trails” option is true if the
sprite is touching any drawn or stamped ink on the stage. Also, touching
will not detect hidden sprites, but a hidden sprite can use it to detect
visible sprites.</p>

height=”3.3319444444444444in”}The “neg” option is a monadic negation
operator, equivalent to . “lg” is log~2~. “id” is the identity function,
which reports its input. “sign” reports 1 for positive input, 0 for zero
input, or -1 for negative input.</p>

clicking, dragging, hovering, etc. The “stopped” option triggers when
all scripts are stopped, as with the stop button; it is useful for
robots whose hardware interface must be told to turn off motors. A when
I am stopped script can run only for a limited time.</p>

arrowhead to expose a script variable (click on it to change its name,
like any script variable) that will be set to the data of a matching
broadcast. If the first input is set to “any message,” then the data
variable will be set to the message, if no payload is included with the
broadcast, or to a two-item list containing the message and the payload.</p>

key is created whose value is the key that was pressed. (If the key is
one that’ represented in the input menu by a word or phrase, e.g.,
“enter” or “up arrow,” then the value of key will be that word or

library.</p>

<p>The of block has an extended menu of attributes of a sprite. Position
reports an (x,y) vector. Size reports the percentage of normal size, as
controlled by the set size block in the Looks category. Left, right,
etc. report the stage coordinates of the corresponding edge of the
sprite’s bounding box. Variables reports a list of the names of all
variables in scope (global, sprite-local, and script variables if the
right input is a script.</p>

<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image384.png" alt="" />{width=”0.3194444444444444in”
height=”0.18055555555555555in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image385.png" alt="" />{width=”7.401388888888889in”
height=”3.238888888888889in”}There are several collections of useful
procedures that aren’t Snap<em>!</em> primitives, but are provided as
libraries. To include a library in your project, choose the Libraries…
option in the file ( ) menu.</p>

<p>When you click on the one-line description of a library, you are shown
the actual blocks in the library and a longer explanation of its
purpose. You can browse the libraries to find one that will satisfy your
needs.</p>

<p>The libraries and their contents may change, but as of this writing the
list library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image387.png" alt="" />{width=”1.8486111111111112in”
height=”2.4923611111111112in”} (The lightning bolt before the name in
several of these blocks means that they use compiled HOFs or JavaScript
primitives to achieve optimal speed. They are officially considered
experimental.) Remove duplicates from reports a list in which no two
items are equal. The sort block takes a list and a two-input comparison
predicate, such as &lt;, and reports a list with the items sorted
according to that comparison. The assoc block is for looking up a key in
an <em>association list:</em> a list of two-item lists. In each two-item list,
the first is a <em>key</em> and the second is a <em>value.</em> The inputs are a key
and an association list; the block reports the first key-value pair
whose key is equal to the input key.</p>

<p>For each item is a variant of the primitive version that provides a #
variable containing the position in the input list of the currently
considered item. Multimap is a version of map that allows multiple list
inputs, in which case the mapping function must take as many inputs as
there are lists; it will be called with all the first items, all the
second items, and so on. Zip takes any number of lists as inputs; it
reports a list of lists: all the first items, all the second items, and
so on. The no-name identity function reports its input.</p>

<p>Sentence and sentence➔list are borrowed from the word and sentence
library (page 27) to serve as a variant of append that accepts non-lists
as inputs. Printable takes a list structure of any depth as input and
reports a compact representation of the list as a text string.</p>

<p>The iteration, composition library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image388.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6888888888888889in”
height=”4.75in”}Catch and throw provide a nonlocal exit facility. You
can drag the tag from a catch block to a throw inside its C-slot, and
the throw will then jump directly out to the matching catch without
doing anything in between.</p>

<p>If do and pause all is for setting a breakpoint while debugging code.
The idea is to put show variable blocks for local variables in the
C-slot; the watchers will be deleted when the user continues from the
pause.</p>

<p>Ignore is used when you need to call a reporter but you don’t care about
the value it reports. (For example, you are writing a script to time how
long the reporter takes.)</p>

<p>The cascade blocks take an initial value and call a function repeatedly
on that value, <em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>f</em>…(<em>x</em>)))).</p>

<p>The compose block takes two functions and reports the function

height=”0.2986111111111111in”}The first three repeat blocks are variants
of the primitive repeat until block, giving all four combinations of
whether the first test happens before or after the first repetition, and
whether the condition must be true or false to continue repeating. The
last repeat block is like the repeat primitive, but makes the number of
repetitions so far available to the repeated script. The next two blocks
are variations on for: the first allows an explicit step instead of
using ±1, and the second allows any values, not just numbers; inside the
script you say</p>

with an expression to give the next desired value for the loop index.
Pipe allows reordering a nested composition with a left-to-right one:</p>

<p>The stream library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image393.png" alt="" />{width=”3.161111111111111in”
height=”2.1534722222222222in”}<em>Streams</em> are a special kind of list whose
items are not computed until they are needed. This makes certain
computations more efficient, and also allows the creation of lists with
infinitely many items, such as a list of all the positive integers. The
first five blocks are stream versions of the list blocks in front of,
item 1 of, all but first of, map, and keep. Show stream takes a stream
and a number as inputs, and reports an ordinary list of the first <em>n</em>
items of the stream. Stream is like the primitive list; it makes a
finite stream from explicit items. Sieve is an example block that takes
as input the stream of integers starting with 2 and reports the stream
of all the prime numbers. Stream with numbers from is like the numbers
from block for lists, except that there is no endpoint; it reports an
infinite stream of numbers.</p>

<p>The word and sentence library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image394.png" alt="" />{width=”1.679861111111111in”
height=”3.6430555555555557in”}This library has the goal of recreating
the Logo approach to handling text: A text isn’t best viewed as a string
of characters, but rather as a <em>sentence</em>, made of <em>words,</em> each of
which is a string of <em>letters.</em> With a few specialized exceptions, this
is why people put text into computers: The text is sentences of natural
(i.e., human) language, and the emphasis is on words as constitutive of
sentences. You barely notice the letters of the words, and you don’t
notice the spaces between them at all, unless you’re proof-reading.
(Even then: Proofreading is <em>diffciult,</em> because you see what you expect
to see, what will make the snetence make sense, rather than the
misspelling in front of of your eyes.) Internally, Logo stores a
sentence as a list of words, and a word as a string of letters.</p>

<p>Inexplicably, the designers of Scratch chose to abandon that tradition,
and to focus on the representation of text as a string of characters.
The one vestige of the Logo tradition from which Scratch developed is
the block named letter (1) of (world), rather than character (1) of
(world). Snap<em>!</em> inherits its text handling from Scratch.</p>

<p>In Logo, the visual representation of a sentence (a list of words) looks
like a natural language sentence: a string of words with spaces between
them. In Snap<em>!</em>, the visual representation of a list looks nothing at
all like natural language. On the other hand, representing a sentence as
a string means that the program must continually re-parse the text on
every operation, looking for spaces, treating multiple consecutive
spaces as one, and so on. Also, it’s more convenient to treat a sentence
as a list of words rather than a string of words because in the former
case you can use the higher order functions map, keep, and combine on
them. This library attempts to be agnostic as to the internal
representation of sentences. The sentence selectors accept any
combination of lists and strings; there are two sentence constructors,
one to make a string (join words) and one to make a list (sentence).</p>

<p>The selector names come from Logo, and should be self-explanatory.
However, because in a block language you don’t have to type the block
name, instead of the terse butfirst or the cryptic bf we spell out “all
but first of” and include “word” or “sentence” to indicate the intended
domain. There’s no first letter of block because letter 1 of serves that
need. Join words (the sentence-as-string constructor) is like the
primitive join except that it puts a space in the reported value between
each of the inputs. Sentence (the List-colored sentence-as-list
constructor) accepts any number of inputs, which can be words,
sentences-as-lists, or sentences-as-strings. (If inputs are lists of
lists, only one level of flattening is done.) Sentence reports a list of
words; there will be no empty words or words containing spaces. The four
blocks with right-arrows in their names convert back and forth between
text strings (words or sentences) and lists. (Splitting a word into a
list of letters is unusual unless you’re a linguist investigating
orthography.) Printable takes a list (including a deep list) of words as
input and reports a text string in which parentheses are used to show
the structure, as in Lisp/Scheme.</p>

<p>The pixels library has one block:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image395.png" alt="" />{width=”0.7791666666666667in”
height=”0.6298611111111111in”}Costumes are first class data in Snap<em>!</em>.
Most of the processing of costume data is done by primitive blocks in
the Looks category. (See page 79.) This library provides snap, which
takes a picture using your computer’s camera and reports it as a
costume.</p>

<p>The bar charts library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image396.png" alt="" />{width=”3.4305555555555554in”
height=”1.9166666666666667in”}Bar chart takes a table (typically from a
CSV data set) as input and reports a summary of the table grouped by the
field in the specified column number. The remaining three inputs are
used only if the field values are numbers, in which case they can be
grouped into buckets (e.g., decades, centuries, etc.). Those inputs
specify the smallest and largest values of interest and, most
importantly, the width of a bucket (10 for decades, 100 for centuries).
If the field isn't numeric, leave these three inputs empty or set them
to zero. Each string value of the field is its own bucket, and they
appear sorted alphabetically.</p>

<p>Bar chart reports a new table with three columns. The first column
contains the bucket name or smallest number. The second column contains
a nonnegative integer that says how many records in the input table fall
into this bucket. The third column is a subtable containing the actual
records from the original table that fall into the bucket. Plot bar
chart takes the table reported by bar chart and graphs it on the stage,
with axes labelled appropriately. The remaining blocks are helpers for
those.</p>

<p>If your buckets aren't of constant width, or you want to group by some
function of more than one field, load the "Frequency Distribution
Analysis" library instead.</p>

<p>The multi-branched conditional library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image397.png" alt="" />{width=”1.85in”
height=”2.479861111111111in”}The catch and throw blocks duplicate ones
in the iteration library, and are included because they are used to
implement the others. The cases block sets up a multi-branch
conditional, similar to cond in Lisp or switch in C-family languages.
The first branch is built into the cases block; it consists of a Boolean
test in the first hexagonal slot and an action script, in the C-slot, to
be run if the test reports true. The remaining branches go in the
variadic hexagonal input at the end; each branch consists of an else if
block, which includes the Boolean test and the corresponding action
script, except possibly for the last branch, which can use the
unconditional else block. As in other languages, once a branch succeeds,
no other branches are tested.</p>

<p>###</p>

<p>The variadic library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image398.png" alt="" />{width=”1.1965277777777779in”
height=”0.4166666666666667in”}These are versions of the associative
operators and, and or that take any number of inputs instead of exactly
two inputs. As with any variadic input, you can also drop a list of
values onto the arrowheads instead of providing the inputs one at a time
As of version 8.0, the arithmetic operators sum, product, minimum, and
maximum are no longer included, because the primitive operators +. ×,
min, and max are themselves variadic.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image399.png" alt="" />{width=”7.277083333333334in”
height=”1.1027777777777779in”}The colors and crayons library has these
blocks:</p>

<p>It is intended as a more powerful replacement for the primitive set pen
block, including <em>first class color</em> support; HSL color specification as
a better alternative to the HSV that Snap<em>!</em> inherits from JavaScript; a
“fair hue” scale that compensates for the eye’s grouping a wide range of
light frequencies as green while labelling mere slivers as orange or
yellow; the X11/W3C standard color names; RGB in hexadecimal; a linear
color scale (as in the old days, but better) based on fair hues and
including shades (darker colors) and grayscale. Another linear scale is
a curated set of 100 “crayons,” explained further on the next page.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image409.png" alt="" />{width=”3.0590277777777777in”

height=”0.225in”}Colors are created by the block (for direct user
selection), the color from block to specify a color numerically, or by ,
which reports the color currently in use by the pen. The from color
block reports names or numbers associated with a color:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image415.png" alt="" />{width=”4.833333333333333in”
height=”0.4305555555555556in”}Colors can be created from other colors:</p>

<p>The three blocks with pen in their names are improved versions of
primitive Pen blocks. In principle set pen, for example, could be
implemented using a (hypothetical) set pen to color composed with the
color from block, but in fact set pen benefits from knowing how the pen
color was set in its previous invocation, so it’s implemented separately
from color from. Details in Appendix A.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image416.png" alt="" />{width=”7.5in”
height=”0.25in”}The recommended way to choose a color is from one of two
linear scales: the continuous <em>color numbers</em> and the discrete
<em>crayons:</em></p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image418.png" alt="" />{width=”4.0in”
height=”0.20833333333333334in”}Color numbers are based on <em>fair hues,</em> a
modification of the spectrum (rainbow) hue scale that devotes less space
to green and more to orange and yellow, as well as promoting brown to a
real color. Here is the normal hue scale, for reference:</p>

height=”0.20833333333333334in”}And here are the 100 crayons:</p>

<p>The color from block, for example, provides different pulldown menus
depending on which scale you choose:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image420.png" alt="" />{width=”2.4166666666666665in”

height=”2.8673611111111112in”}You can also type the crayon name: There
are many scales:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image427.png" alt="" />{width=”4.291666666666667in”

height=”0.5347222222222222in”} The white slot at the end of some of the
blocks has two purposes. It can be used to add a transparency to a color
(0=opaque, 100=transparent):</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image432.png" alt="" />{width=”7.029861111111111in”
height=”0.4305555555555556in”}or it can be expanded to enter three or
four numbers for a vector directly into the block, so these are
equivalent:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image436.png" alt="" />{width=”7.493055555555555in”
height=”0.4305555555555556in”}But note that a transparency number in a
four-number RGBA vector is on the scale 255=opaque, 0=transparent, so
the following are <em>not</em> equivalent:</p>

<p>Set pen crayon to provides the equivalent of a box of 100 crayons. They
are divided into color groups, so the menu in the set pen crayon to
input slot has submenus. The colors are chosen so that starting
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image440.png" alt="" />{width=”4.365277777777778in”
height=”0.5152777777777777in”}from crayon 0, change pen crayon by 10
rotates through an interesting, basic set of ten colors:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image441.png" alt="" />{width=”4.355555555555555in”
height=”0.28194444444444444in”}Using change pen crayon by 5 instead
gives ten more colors, for a total of 20:</p>

<p>(Why didn’t we use the colors of the 100-crayon Crayola™ box? A few
reasons, one of which is that some Crayola colors aren’t representable
on RGB screens. Some year when you have nothing else to do, look up
“color space” on Wikipedia. Also “crayon.” Oh, it’s deliberate that
change pen crayon by 5 doesn’t include white, since that’s the usual
stage background color. White is crayon 14.) Note that crayon 43 is
“Variables”; all the standard block colors are included.</p>

<p>See Appendix A (page 139) for more information.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image442.png" alt="" />{width=”1.51in”
height=”0.9in”}The <strong>crayon library</strong> has only the crayon features,
without the rest of the colors package.</p>

<p>The catch errors library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image443.png" alt="" />{width=”0.4305555555555556in”
height=”0.1527777777777778in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image444.png" alt="" />{width=”3.0416666666666665in”
height=”1.3958333333333333in”}The safely try block allows you to handle
errors that happen when your program is run within the program, instead
of stopping the script with a red halo and an obscure error message. The
block runs the script in its first C-slot. If it finishes without an
error, nothing else happens. But if an error happens, the code in the
second C-slot is run. While that second script is running, the variable
contains the text of the error message that would have been displayed if
you weren’t catching the error. The error block is sort of the opposite:
it lets your program <em>generate</em> an error message, which will be
displayed with a red halo unless it is caught by safely try. Safely try
reporting is the reporter version of safely try.</p>

<p>The text costumes library has only two blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image445.png" alt="" />{width=”0.5347222222222222in”
height=”0.20833333333333334in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image446.png" alt="" />{width=”1.92in”
height=”0.4507830271216098in”}Costume from text reports a costume that
can be used with the switch to

height=”0.18958333333333333in”}costume block to make a button:</p>

<p>Costume with background reports a costume made from another costume by
coloring its background, taking a color input like the set pen color to
RGB(A) block and a number of turtle steps of padding around the original
costume. These two blocks work together to make even better buttons:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image448.png" alt="" />{width=”5.51in” height=”0.68in”}</p>

<p>The text to speech library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image449.png" alt="" />{width=”2.275in”
height=”0.8in”}This library interfaces with a capability in up-to-date
browsers, so it might not work for you. It works best if the accent
matches the text!</p>

<p>The parallelization library contains these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image450.png" alt="" />{width=”1.179861111111111in”
height=”1.2597222222222222in”}The two do in parallel blocks take any
number of scripts as inputs. Those scripts will be run in parallel, like
ordinary independent scripts in the scripting area. The and wait version
waits until all of those scripts have finished before continuing the
script below the block.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image451.png" alt="" />{width=”1.3777777777777778in”
height=”1.4833333333333334in”}The create variables library has these
blocks:</p>

<p>These blocks allow a program to perform the same operation as the</p>

<p>button, making global, sprite local, or script variables, but allowing
the program to compute the variable name(s). It can also set and find
the values of these variables, show and hide their stage watchers,
delete them, and find out if they already exist.</p>

<p>The getters and setters library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image452.png" alt="" />{width=”1.875in”
height=”1.05in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image453.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”
height=”0.16666666666666666in”}The purpose of this library is to allow
program access to the settings controlled by user interface elements,
such as the settings menu. The setting block reports a setting; the set
flag block sets yes-or-no options that have checkboxes in the user
interface, while the set value block controls settings with numeric or
text values, such as project name.</p>

<p>Certain settings are ordinarily remembered on a per-user basis, such as
the “zoom blocks” value. But when these settings are changed by this
library, the change is in effect only while the project using the
library is loaded. No permanent changes are made. Note: this library has
not been converted for version 7.0, so you’ll have to enable Javascript
extensions to use it.</p>

<p>The bignums, rationals, complex #s library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image454.png" alt="" />{width=”1.875in”
height=”1.55in”}The USE BIGNUMS block takes a Boolean input, to turn the
infinite precision feature on or off. When on, all of the arithmetic
operators are redefined to accept and report integers of any number of
digits (limited only by the memory of your computer) and, in fact, the
entire Scheme numeric tower, with exact rationals and with complex
numbers. The Scheme number block has a list of functions applicable to
Scheme numbers, including subtype predicates such as rational? and
infinite?, and selectors such as numerator and real-part.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image455.png" alt="" />{width=”4.836805555555555in”
height=”0.4166666666666667in”}The ! block computes the factorial
function, useful to test whether bignums are turned on. Without bignums:</p>

<p>With bignums:</p>

height=”0.36041666666666666in”}The 375-digit value of 200! isn’t
readable on this page, but if you right-click on the block and choose
“result pic,” you can open the resulting picture in a browser window and
scroll through it. (These values end with a bunch of zero digits. That’s
not roundoff error; the prime factors of 100! and 200! include many
copies of 2 and 5.) The block with no name is a way to enter things like
3/4 and 4+7i into numeric input slots by converting the slot to Any
type.</p>

<p>The strings, multi-line input library provides these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image463.png" alt="" />{width=”3.9375in”
height=”2.0416666666666665in”}All of these could be written in Snap<em>!</em>
itself, but these are implemented using the corresponding JavaScript
library functions directly, so they run fast. They can be used, for
example, in scraping data from a web site. The command use
case-independent comparisons applies only to this library. The multiline
block accepts and reports a text input that can include newline
characters.</p>

<p>The animation library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image464.png" alt="" />{width=”4.0125in”
height=”2.33125in”}Despite the name, this isn’t only about graphics; you
can animate the values of a variable, or anything else that’s expressed
numerically.</p>

height=”0.19444444444444445in”}The central idea of this library is an
<em>easing function,</em> a reporter whose domain and range are real numbers
between 0 and 1 inclusive. The function represents what fraction of the
“distance” (in quotes because it might be any numeric value, such as
temperature in a simulation of weather) from here to there should be
covered in what fraction of the time. A linear easing function means
steady progression. A quadratic easing function means starting slowly
and accelerating. (Note that, since it’s a requirement that <em>f</em>(0)=0 and
<em>f</em>(1)=1, there is only one linear easing function, <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)=<em>x</em>, and
similarly for other categories.) The block reports some of the common
easing functions.</p>

height=”0.6319444444444444in”}The two Motion blocks in this library
animate a sprite. Glide always animates the sprite’s motion. Animate’s
first pulldown menu input allows you to animate horizontal or vertical
motion, but will also animate the sprite’s direction or size. The
animate block in Control lets you animate any numeric quantity with any
easing function. The getter and setter inputs are best explained by
example:</p>

height=”2.98125in”}This library takes a sound, one that you record or
one from our collection of sounds, and manipulates it by systematically
changing the intensity of the samples in the sound and by changing the
sampling rate at which the sound is reproduced. Many of the blocks are
helpers for the plot sound block, used to plot the waveform of a sound.
The play sound (primitive) block plays a sound. __ Hz for reports a
sine wave as a list of samples.</p>

<p>The web services library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image471.png" alt="" />{width=”3.4097222222222223in”
height=”1.1041666666666667in”}The first block is a generalization of the
primitive url block, allowing more control over the various options in
web requests: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and fine control over the
content of the message sent to the server. Current location reports your
latitude and longitude. Listify takes some text in JSON format (see page
54) and converts it to a structured list. Value at key looks up a
key-value pair in a (listified) JSON dictionary. The key:value: block is
just a constructor for an abstract data type used with the other blocks</p>

<p>The database library contains these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image472.png" alt="" />{width=”2.263888888888889in”
height=”1.2222222222222223in”}It is used to keep data that persist from
one Snap<em>!</em> session to the next, if you use the same browser and the
same login.</p>

<p>The world map library has these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image473.png" alt="" />{width=”2.442361111111111in”
height=”3.4027777777777777in”}Using any of the command blocks puts a map
on the screen, in a layer in front of the stage’s background but behind
the pen trails layer (which is in turn behind all the sprites). The
first block asks your browser for your current physical location, for
which you may be asked to give permission. The next two blocks get and
set the map’s zoom amount; the default zoom of 10 ﬁts from San Francisco
not quite down to Palo Alto on the screen. A zoom of 1 ﬁts almost the
entire world. A zoom of 3 fits the United States; a zoom of 5 ﬁts
Germany. The zoom can be changed in half steps, i.e., 5.5 is different
from 5, but 5.25 isn’t.</p>

<p>The next five blocks convert between stage coordinates (pixels) and
Earth coordinates (latitude and longitude). The change by x: y: block
shifts the map relative to the stage. The distance to block measures the
map distance (in meters) between two sprites. The three reporters with
current in their names find <em>your</em> actual location, again supposing that
geolocation is enabled on your device. Update redraws the map; as
costume reports the visible section of the map as a costume. Set style
allows things like satellite pictures.</p>

<p>The APL primitives library contains these blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image474.png" alt="" />{width=”5.733333333333333in”
height=”1.1133333333333333in”}</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image475.png" alt="" />{width=”6.453333333333333in”
height=”2.04in”}</p>

<p>For more information about APL, see Appendix B (page 148).</p>

<p>The <img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image476.png" alt="" />{width=”1.2in”
height=”0.4895833333333333in”}<strong>list comprehension library</strong> has one
block, zip. Its first input is a function of two inputs. The two
Any-type inputs are deep lists (lists of lists of…) interpreted as
trees, and the function is called with every possible combination of a
leaf node of the first tree and a leaf node of the second tree. But
instead of taking atoms (non-lists) as the leaves, zip allows the leaves
of each tree to be vectors (one-dimensional lists), matrices
(two-dimensional lists), etc. The Number-type inputs specify the leaf
dimension for each tree, so the function input might be called with a
vector from the first tree and an atom from the second tree.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image477.png" alt="" />{width=”0.89in”
height=”1.51in”}The <strong>bitwise library</strong> provides bitwise logic
functions; each bit of the reported value is the result of applying the
corresponding Boolean function to the corresponding bits of the
input(s). The Boolean functions are not for ¬, and for ∧, or for ∨, and
xor (exclusive or) for ⊻. The remaining functions shift their first
input left or right by the number of bits given by the second input.
&lt;&lt; is left shift, &gt;&gt; is arithmetic right shift (shifting in one bits
from the left), and &gt;&gt;&gt; is logical right shift (shifting in zero bits
from the left). If you don’t already know what these mean, find a
tutorial online.</p>

height=”1.6097222222222223in”}</p>

<p>The <strong>MQTT library</strong> supports the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
protocol, for connecting with IOT devices. See <a href="https://mqtt.org/">https://mqtt.org/</a> for
more information.</p>

height=”2.8895833333333334in”}The <strong>Signada library</strong> allows you to
control a microBit or similar device that works with the Signada
MicroBlocks project.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image486.png" alt="" />{width=”3.39in” height=”1.9in”}</p>

<p>The <strong>menus library</strong> provides the ability to display hierarchical menus
on the stage, using the ask block’s ability to take lists as inputs. See
page 24.</p>

<p>The <strong>SciSnap<em>!</em> library</strong> and the <strong>TuneScope library</strong> are too big to
discuss here and are documented separately at

<h1 id="saving-and-loading-projects-and-media">Saving and Loading Projects and Media</h1>

<p>After you’ve created a project, you’ll want to save it, so that you can
have access to it the next time you use Snap<em>!</em>. There are two ways to
do that. You can save a project on your own computer, or you can save it
at the Snap<em>!</em> web site. The advantage of saving on the net is that you
have access to your project even if you are using a different computer,
or a mobile device such as a tablet or smartphone. The advantage of
saving on your computer is that you have access to the saved project
while on an airplane or otherwise not on the net. Also, cloud projects
are limited in size, but you can have all the costumes and sounds you
like if you save locally. This is why we have multiple ways to save.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image487.png" alt="" />{width=”3.548611111111111in”
height=”2.576388888888889in”}In either case, if you choose “Save as…”
from the File menu. You’ll see something like this:</p>

<p>(If you are not logged in to your Snap<em>!</em> cloud account, Computer will
be the only usable option.) The text box at the bottom right of the Save
dialog allows you to enter project notes that are saved with the
project.</p>

<h2 id="local-storage">Local Storage</h2>

<p>Click on Computer and Snap<em>!</em>’s Save Project dialog window will be
replaced by your operating system’s standard save window. If your
project has a name, that name will be the default filename if you don’t
give a different name. Another, equivalent way to save to disk is to
choose “Export project” from the File menu.</p>

<h2 id="width12340277777777777in-height2329861111111111increating-a-cloud-account"><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image488.png" alt="" />{width=”1.2340277777777777in” height=”2.329861111111111in”}Creating a Cloud Account</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image489.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”
height=”0.16666666666666666in”}The other possibility is to save your
project “in the cloud,” at the Snap<em>!</em> web site. In order to do this,
you need an account with us. Click on the Cloud button ( ) in the Tool
Bar. Choose the “Signup…” option. This will show you a window that
looks like the picture at the right.</p>

<p>You must choose a user name that will identify you on the web site, such
as Jens or bh. If you’re a Scratch user, you can use your Scratch name
for Snap<em>!</em> too. If you’re a kid, don’t pick a user name that includes
your family name, but first names or initials are okay. Don’t pick
something you’d be embarrassed to have other users (or your parents)
see! If the name you want is already taken, you’ll have to choose
another one. You must also supply a password.</p>

<p>We ask for your month and year of birth; we use this information only to
decide whether to ask for your own email address or your parent’s email
address. (If you’re a kid, you shouldn’t sign up for anything on the
net, not even Snap<em>!</em>, without your parent’s knowledge.) We do not store
your birthdate information on our server; it is used on your own
computer only during this initial signup. We do not ask for your <em>exact</em>
birthdate, even for this one-time purpose, because that’s an important
piece of personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>When you click OK, an email will be sent to the email address you gave,
asking you to verify (by clicking a link) that it’s really your email
address. We keep your email address on file so that, if you forget your
password, we can send you a password-reset link. We will also email you
if your account is suspended for violation of the Terms of Service. We
do not use your address for any other purpose. You will never receive
marketing emails of any kind through this site, neither from us nor from
third parties. If, nevertheless, you are worried about providing this
information, do a web search for “temporary email.”</p>

<p>Finally, you must read and agree to the Terms of Service. A quick
summary: Don’t interfere with anyone else’s use of the web site, and
don’t put copyrighted media or personally identifiable information in
projects that you share with other users. And we’re not responsible if
something goes wrong. (Not that we <em>expect</em> anything to go wrong; since
Snap<em>!</em> runs in JavaScript in your browser, it is strongly isolated from
the rest of your computer. But the lawyers make us say this.)</p>

<h2 id="saving-to-the-cloud">Saving to the Cloud</h2>

<p>Once you’ve created your account, you can log into it using the
“Login…” option from the Cloud menu:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image490.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6875in”
height=”2.0277777777777777in”}Use the user name and password that you
set up earlier. If you check the “Stay signed in” box, then you will be
logged in automatically the next time you run Snap<em>!</em> from the same
browser on the same computer. Check the box if you’re using your own
computer and you don’t share it with siblings. <em>Don’t</em> check the box if
you’re using a public computer at the library, at school, etc.</p>

<p>Once logged in, you can choose the “Cloud” option in the “Save Project”
dialog shown on page 37. You enter a project name, and optionally
project notes; your project will be saved online and can be loaded from
anywhere with net access. The project notes will be visible to other
users if you publish your project.</p>

<h2 id="loading-saved-projects">Loading Saved Projects</h2>

<p>Once you’ve saved a project, you want to be able to load it back into
Snap<em>!</em>. There are two ways to do this:</p>

<p>1. If you saved the project in your online Snap<em>!</em> account, choose the
“Open…” option from the File menu. Choose the “Cloud” button, then
select your project from the list in the big text box and click OK, or
choose the “Computer” button to open an operating system open dialog. (A
third button, “Examples,” lets you choose from example projects that we
provide. You can see what each of these projects is about by clicking on
it and reading its project notes.)</p>

<p>2. If you saved the project as an XML file on your computer, choose
“Import…” from the File menu. This will give you an ordinary browser
file-open window, in which you can navigate to the file as you would in
other software. Alternatively, find the XML file on your desktop, and
just drag it onto the Snap<em>!</em> window.</p>

<p>The second technique above also allows you to import media (costumes and
sounds) into a project. Just choose “Import…” and then select a
picture or sound file instead of an XML file.</p>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> can also import projects created in BYOB 3.0 or 3.1, or (with
some effort; see our web site) in Scratch 1.4, 2.0 or 3.0. Almost all
such projects work correctly in Snap<em>!</em>, apart from a small number of
incompatible blocks.</p>

<p>If you saved projects in an earlier version of Snap<em>!</em> using the
“Browser” option, then a Browser button will be shown in the Open dialog
to allow you to retrieve those projects. But you can save them only with
the Computer and Cloud options.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-lose-your-project-do-this-first">If you lose your project, do this first!</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image384.png" alt="" />{width=”0.3194444444444444in”
height=”0.18055555555555555in”}If you are still in <strong>Snap<em>!</em></strong> and
realize that you’ve loaded another project without saving the one you
were working on: <strong><em>Don’t edit the new project.</em></strong> From the File menu
choose the Restore unsaved project option.</p>

<p>Restore unsaved project will also work if you log out of Snap<em>!</em> and
later log back in, as long as you don’t edit another project meanwhile.
Snap<em>!</em> remembers only the most recent project that you’ve edited (not
just opened, but actually changed in the project editor).</p>

<p>If your project on the cloud is missing, empty, or otherwise broken and
isn’t the one you edited most recently, or if Restore unsaved project
fails: <strong><em>Don’t edit the broken project.</em></strong> In the Open… box, enter
your project name, then push the Recover button. <em>Do this right away,</em>
because we save only the version before the most recent, and the latest
before today. So don’t keep saving bad versions; Recover right away. The
Recover feature works only on a project version that you actually saved,
so Restore unsaved project is your first choice if you switch away from
a project without saving it.</p>

<p>To help you remember to save your projects, when you’ve edited the
project and haven’t yet saved it, Snap<em>!</em> displays a pencil icon to the
left of the project name on the toolbar at the top of the window:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image491.png" alt="" />{width=”6.29671697287839in”
height=”0.5138888888888888in”}</p>

<h2 id="private-and-public-projects">Private and Public Projects</h2>

<p>By default, a project you save in the cloud is private; only you can see
it. There are two ways to make a project available to others. If you
share a project, you can give your friends a project URL (in your
browser’s URL bar after you open the project) they can use to read it.
If you publish a project, it will appear on the Snap<em>!</em> web site, and
the whole world can see it. In any case, nobody other than you can ever
overwrite your project; if others ask to save it, they get their own
copy in their own account.</p>

<h1 id="building-a-block">Building a Block</h1>

<p>The first version of Snap<em>!</em> was called BYOB, for “Build Your Own
Blocks.” This was the first and is still the most important capability
we added to Scratch. (The name was changed because a few teachers have
no sense of humor. ☹ You pick your battles.) Scratch 2.0 and later also
has a partial custom block capability.</p>

<h2 id="simple-blocks">Simple Blocks</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image495.png" alt="" />{width=”7.5in”
height=”2.7152777777777777in”}In every palette, at or near the bottom,
is a button labeled “Make a block.” Also, floating near the top of the
palette is a plus sign. Also, the menu you get by right-clicking on the
background of the scripting area has a “make a block” option.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image501.png" alt="" />{width=”2.2708333333333335in”
height=”2.3472222222222223in”}Clicking any of these will display a
dialog window in which you choose the block’s name, shape, and
palette/color. You also decide whether the block will be available to
all sprites, or only to the current sprite and its children.</p>

<p>In this dialog box, you can choose the block's palette, shape, and
name. With one exception, there is one color per palette, e.g., all
Motion blocks are blue. But the Variables palette includes the orange
variable-related blocks and the red list-related blocks. Both colors are
available, along with an “Other” option that makes grey blocks in the
Variables palette for blocks that don’t fit any category.</p>

<p>There are three block shapes, following a convention that should be
familiar to Scratch users: The jigsaw-puzzle-piece shaped blocks are
Commands, and don’t report a value. The oval blocks are Reporters, and
the hexagonal blocks are Predicates, which is the technical term for
reporters that report Boolean (true or false) values.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to make a block named “square” that draws a square. You
would choose Motion, Command, and type “square” into the name field.
When you click OK, you enter the Block Editor. This works just like
making a script in the sprite’s scripting area, except that the “hat”
block at the top, instead of saying something like “when I am clicked,”
has a picture of the block you’re building. This hat block is called the
<em>prototype</em> of your custom block.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> You drag blocks under the hat to
program your custom block, then click OK:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image502.png" alt="" />{width=”4.210937226596675in”
height=”1.3364041994750657in”}</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image503.png" alt="" />{width=”4.615555555555556in”
height=”3.647777777777778in”}</p>

<p>Your block appears at the bottom of the Motion palette. Here’s the block
and the result of using it:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image504.png" alt="" />{width=”4.242361111111111in”
height=”1.4166666666666667in”}</p>

<h3 id="custom-blocks-with-inputs">Custom Blocks with Inputs</h3>

<p>But suppose you want to be able to draw squares of different sizes.
Control-click or right-click on the block, choose “edit,” and the Block
Editor will open. Notice the plus signs before and after the word square
in the prototype block. If you hover the mouse over one, it lights up:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image508.png" alt="" />{width=”3.4444444444444446in”
height=”2.7222222222222223in”}</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image509.png" alt="" />{width=”2.5833333333333335in”
height=”1.6041666666666667in”}Click on the plus on the right. You will
then see the “input name” dialog:</p>

<p>Type in the name “size” and click OK. There are other options in this
dialog; you can choose “title text” if you want to add words to the
block name, so it can have text after an input slot, like the “move ( )
steps” block. Or you can select a more extensive dialog with a lot of
options about your input name. But we’ll leave that for later. When you
click OK, the new input appears in the block prototype:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image510.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4791666666666667in”
height=”1.4895833333333333in”}You can now drag the orange variable down
into the script, then click okay:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image511.png" alt="" />{width=”1.474724409448819in”
height=”1.495495406824147in”}</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image512.png" alt="" />{width=”0.6979166666666666in”
height=”0.25in”}Your block now appears in the Motion palette with an
input box: You can draw any size square by entering the length of its
side in the box and running the block as usual, by clicking it or by
putting it in a script.</p>

<h3 id="editing-block-properties">Editing Block Properties</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image513.png" alt="" />{width=”0.9993055555555556in”
height=”0.7604166666666666in”}What if you change your mind about a
block’s color (palette) or shape (command, reporter, predicate)? If you
click in the hat block at the top that holds the prototype, but not in
the prototype itself, you’ll see a window in which you can change the
color, and <em>sometimes</em> the shape, namely, if the block is not used in
any script, whether in a scripting area or in another custom block.
(This includes a one-block script consisting of a copy of the new block
pulled out of the palette into the scripting area, seeing which made you
realize it’s the wrong category. Just delete that copy (drag it back to
the palette) and then change the category.)</p>

<p>If you right-click/control-click the hat block, you get this menu:</p>

<p>Script pic exports a picture of the script. (Many of the illustrations
in this manual were made that way.) Translations opens a window in which
you can specify how your block should be translated if the user chooses
a language other than the one in which you are programming. Block
variables lets you create a variant of script variables for this block:
A script variable is created when a block is called, and it disappears
when that call finishes. What if you want a variable that’s local to
this block, as a script variable is, but doesn’t disappear between
invocations? That’s a block variable. If the definition of a block
includes a block variable, then every time that (custom) block is
dragged from the palette into a script, the block variable is created.
Every time <em>that copy</em> of the block is called, it uses the same block
variable, which preserves its value between calls. Other copies of the
block have their own block variables. The in palette checkbox determines
whether or not this block will be visible in the palette. It’s normally
checked, but you may want to hide custom blocks if you’re a curriculum
writer creating a Parsons problem. To unhide blocks, choose “Hide
blocks” from the File menu and uncheck the checkboxes. Edit does the
same thing as regular clicking, as described earlier.</p>

<h2 id="recursion">Recursion</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image514.png" alt="" />{width=”2.9652777777777777in”
height=”2.3631944444444444in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image515.png" alt="" />{width=”1.9583333333333333in”
height=”2.3541666666666665in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image516.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4236111111111112in”
height=”0.9118055555555555in”}Since the new custom block appears in its
palette as soon as you <em>start</em> editing it, you can write recursive
blocks (blocks that call themselves) by dragging the block into its own
definition:</p>

<p>(If you added inputs to the block since opening the editor, click Apply
before finding the block in the palette, or drag the block from the top
of the block editor rather than from the palette.)</p>

<p>If recursion is new to you, here are a few brief hints: It’s crucial
that the recursion have a <em>base case,</em> that is, some small(est) case
that the block can handle without using recursion. In this example, it’s
the case depth=0, for which the block does nothing at all, because of
the enclosing if. Without a base case, the recursion would run forever,
calling itself over and over.</p>

<p>Don’t try to trace the exact sequence of steps that the computer follows
in a recursive program. Instead, imagine that inside the computer there
are many small people, and if Theresa is drawing a tree of size 100,
depth 6, she hires Tom to make a tree of size 70, depth 5, and later
hires Theo to make another tree of size 70, depth 5. Tom in turn hires
Tammy and Tallulah, and so on. Each little person has his or her own
local variables size and depth, each with different values.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image517.png" alt="" />{width=”4.8380686789151355in”
height=”1.5833333333333333in”}You can also write recursive reporters,
like this block to compute the factorial function:</p>

<p>Note the use of the report block. When a reporter block uses this block,
the reporter finishes its work and reports the value given; any further
blocks in the script are not evaluated. Thus, the if else block in the
script above could have been just an if, with the second report block
below it instead of inside it, and the result would be the same, because
when the ﬁrst report is seen in the base case, that finishes the block
invocation, and the second report is ignored. There is also a stop this
block block that has a similar purpose, ending the block invocation
early, for command blocks. (By contrast, the stop this script block
stops not only the current block invocation, but also the entire
toplevel script that called it.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image521.png" alt="" />{width=”4.291666666666667in”
height=”0.8645833333333334in”}Here’s a slightly more compact way to
write the factorial function:</p>

<p>For more on recursion, see <em>Thinking Recursively</em> by Eric Roberts. (The
original edition is ISBN <strong>978‑0471816522; a more recent <em>Thinking
Recursively in Java</em> is ISBN 978-0471701460.)</strong></p>

<h2 id="block-libraries">Block Libraries</h2>

<p>When you save a project (see Chapter II above), any custom blocks you’ve
made are saved with it. But sometimes you’d like to save a collection of
blocks that you expect to be useful in more than one project. Perhaps
your blocks implement a particular data structure (a stack, or a
dictionary, etc.), or they’re the framework for building a multilevel
game. Such a collection of blocks is called a <em>block library.</em></p>

<p>*<br />
*To create a block library, choose “Export blocks…” from the File
menu. You then see a window like this:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image522.png" alt="" />{width=”2.0215277777777776in”
height=”2.7222222222222223in”}The window shows all of your global custom
blocks. You can uncheck some of the checkboxes to select exactly which
blocks you want to include in your library. (You can right-click or
control-click on the export window for a menu that lets you check or
uncheck all the boxes at once.) Then press OK. An XML file containing
the blocks will appear in your Downloads location.</p>

<p>To import a block library, use the “Import…” command in the File menu,
or just drag the XML file into the Snap<em>!</em> window.</p>

<p>Several block libraries are included with Snap<em>!</em>; for details about
them, see page 25.</p>

<h2 id="custom-blocks-and-visible-stepping">Custom blocks and Visible Stepping</h2>

<p>Visible stepping normally treats a call to a custom block as a single
step. If you want to see stepping inside a custom block you must take
these steps <em>in order:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image123.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”
height=”0.16666666666666666in”}Turn on Visible Stepping.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select “Edit” in the context menu(s) of the block(s) you want to
examine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then start the program.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Block Editor windows you open in step 2 do not have full editing
capability. You can tell because there is only one “OK” button at the
bottom, not the usual three buttons. Use the button to close these
windows when done stepping.</p>

<h1 id="first-class-lists">First class lists</h1>

<p>A data type is <em>ﬁrst class</em> in a programming language if data of that
type can be</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the value of a variable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an input to a procedure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the value returned by a procedure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a member of a data aggregate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>anonymous (not named)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In Scratch, numbers and text strings are ﬁrst class. You can put a
number in a variable, use one as the input to a block, call a reporter
that reports a number, or put a number into a list.</p>

<p>But Scratch’s lists are not ﬁrst class. You create one using the “Make a
list” button, which requires that you give the list a name. You can’t
put the list into a variable, into an input slot of a block, or into a
list item—you can’t have lists of lists. None of the Scratch reporters
reports a list value. (You can use a reduction of the list into a text
string as input to other blocks, but this loses the list structure; the
input is just a text string, not a data aggregate.)</p>

<p>A fundamental design principle in Snap<em>!</em> is that <em><strong>[all data should be
ﬁrst class]{.underline}</strong>.</em> If it’s in the language, then we should be
able to use it fully and freely. We believe that this principle avoids
the need for many special-case tools, which can instead be written by
Snap<em>!</em> users themselves.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image523.png" alt="" />{width=”2.839583333333333in”
height=”0.41597222222222224in”}Note that it’s a data <em>type</em> that’s ﬁrst
class, not an individual value. Don’t think, for example, that some
lists are ﬁrst class, while others aren’t. In Snap<em>!</em>, lists are ﬁrst
class, period.</p>

<h2 id="the-list-block">The list Block</h2>

<p>At the heart of providing first class lists is the ability to make an
“anonymous” list—to make a list without simultaneously giving it a
name. The list reporter block does that.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image524.png" alt="" />{width=”4.2in”
height=”1.5694444444444444in”}At the right end of the block are two
left-and-right arrowheads. Clicking on these changes the number of
inputs to list, i.e., the number of elements in the list you are
building. Shift-clicking changes by three at a time.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image534.png" alt="" />{width=”1.5034722222222223in”
height=”1.8125in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image535.png" alt="" />{width=”2.24375in”
height=”0.3215277777777778in”}You can use this block as input to many
other blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image536.png" alt="" />{width=”3.09375in”
height=”0.7708333333333334in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image537.png" alt="" />{width=”1.8229166666666667in”
height=”0.2916666666666667in”}Snap<em>!</em> does not have a “Make a list”
button like the one in Scratch. If you want a global “named list,” make
a global variable and use the set block to put a list into the variable.</p>

<h2 id="lists-of-lists">Lists of Lists</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image538.png" alt="" />{width=”5.888888888888889in”
height=”1.0486111111111112in”}Lists can be inserted as elements in
larger lists. We can easily create ad hoc structures as needed:</p>

<p>Notice that this list is presented in a different format from the “She
Loves You” list above. A two-dimensional list is called a <em>table</em> and is
by default shown in <em>table view.</em> We’ll have more to say about this
later.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image539.png" alt="" />{width=”7.343055555555556in”
height=”2.78125in”}We can also build any classic computer science data
structure out of lists of lists, by defining <em>constructors</em> (blocks to
make an instance of the structure), <em>selectors</em> (blocks to pull out a
piece of the structure), and <em>mutators</em> (blocks to change the contents
of the structure) as needed. Here we create binary trees with selectors
that check for input of the correct data type; only one selector is
shown but the ones for left and right children are analogous.</p>

<h2 id="functional-and-imperative-list-programming">Functional and Imperative List Programming</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image543.png" alt="" />{width=”2.1041666666666665in”
height=”1.09375in”} There are two ways to create a list inside a
program. Scratch users will be familiar with the <em>imperative</em>
programming style, which is based on a set of command blocks that modify
a list:</p>

<p>As an example, here are two blocks that take a list of numbers as input,
and report a new list containing only the even numbers from the original
list:<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image551.png" alt="" />{width=”5.892361111111111in”
height=”2.28125in”}</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>In this script, we first create a temporary variable, then put an empty
list in it, then go through the items of the input list using the add
<strong>…</strong> to (result) block to modify the result list, adding one item at
a time, and finally report the result.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image195.png" alt="" />{width=”1.5625in”
height=”0.8104166666666667in”}<em>Functional</em> programming is a different
approach that is becoming important in “real world” programming because
of parallelism, i.e., the fact that different processors can be
manipulating the same data at the same time. This makes the use of
mutation (changing the value associated with a variable, or the items of
a list) problematic because with parallelism it’s impossible to know the
exact sequence of events, so the result of mutation may not be what the
programmer expected. Even without parallelism, though, functional
programming is sometimes a simpler and more effective technique,
especially when dealing with recursively defined data structures. It
uses reporter blocks, not command blocks, to build up a list value:</p>

<p>In a functional program, we often use recursion to construct a list, one
item at a time. The in front of block makes a list that has one item
added to the front of an existing list, <em>without changing the value of
the original list.</em> A nonempty list is processed by dividing it into its
first item (item 1 of) and all the rest of the items (all but first of),
which are handled through a recursive call:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image555.png" alt="" />{width=”4.75in”
height=”2.240972222222222in”}Snap<em>!</em> uses two different internal
representations of lists, one (dynamic array) for imperative programming
and the other (linked list) for functional programming. Each
representation makes the corresponding built-in list blocks (commands or
reporters, respectively) most efficient. It’s possible to mix styles in
the same program, but if <em>the same list</em> is used both ways, the program
will run more slowly because it converts from one representation to the
other repeatedly. (The item ( ) of [ ] block doesn’t change the
representation.) You don’t have to know the details of the internal
representations, but it’s worthwhile to use each list in a consistent
way.</p>

<h2 id="width5864583333333333in-height10715277777777779inhigher-order-list-operations-and-rings"><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image556.png" alt="" />{width=”5.864583333333333in” height=”1.0715277777777779in”}Higher Order List Operations and Rings</h2>

<p>There’s an even easier way to select the even numbers from a list:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image557.png" alt="" />{width=”2.375in”
height=”0.2777777777777778in”}The keep block takes a Predicate
expression as its first input, and a list as its second input. It
reports a list containing those elements of the input list for which the
predicate returns true. Notice two things about the predicate input:
First, it has a grey ring around it. Second, the mod block has an empty
input. Keep puts each item of its input list, one at a time, into that
empty input before evaluating the predicate. (The empty input is
supposed to remind you of the “box” notation for variables in elementary
school: ☐+3=7.) The grey ring is part of the keep block as it appears in
the palette:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image558.png" alt="" />{width=”4.1402777777777775in”
height=”0.6354166666666666in”}What the ring means is that this input is
a block (a predicate block, in this case, because the interior of the
ring is a hexagon), rather than the value reported by that block. Here’s
the difference:</p>

<p>Evaluating the = block without a ring reports true or false; evaluating
the block <em>with</em> a ring reports the block itself. This allows keep to
evaluate the = predicate repeatedly, once for each list item. A block
that takes another block as input is called a <em>higher order</em> block (or
higher order procedure, or higher order function).</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image562.png" alt="" />{width=”2.39in”
height=”0.22in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image563.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6944444444444444in”
height=”0.9930555555555556in”} Snap<em>!</em> provides four higher order
function blocks for operating on lists:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image571.emf" alt="" />{width=”7.5in”
height=”1.7138888888888888in”}You’ve already seen keep. Find first is
similar, but it reports just the first item that satisfies the
predicate, not a list of all the matching items. It’s equivalent to but
faster because it</p>

<p>stops looking as soon as it finds a match. If there are no matching
items, it returns an empty string.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image572.png" alt="" />{width=”7.589583333333334in”
height=”1.0791666666666666in”}</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image574.png" alt="" />{width=”7.486111111111111in”
height=”1.0020833333333334in”}These examples use small lists, to fit the
page, but the higher order blocks work for any size list.</p>

<p>An <em>empty</em> gray ring represents the <em>identity function,</em> which just
reports its input. Leaving the ring in map empty is the most concise way
to make a shallow copy of a list (that is, in the case of a list of
lists, the result is a new toplevel list whose items are the same
(uncopied) lists that are items of the toplevel input list). To make a
deep copy of a list (that is, one in which all the sublists, sublists of
sublists, etc. are copied), use the list as input to the <img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image576.png" alt="Macintosh
HD:Users:bh:Desktop:id.png" />{width=”0.7430555555555556in”
height=”0.19444444444444445in”} block (one of the variants of the sqrt
of block). This works because id of is a hyperblock (page 55).</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image313.png" alt="" />{width=”5.5800503062117235in”
height=”0.4623108048993876in”}The third higher order block, combine,
computes a single result from <em>all</em> the items of a list, using a
<em>two-input</em> reporter as its second input. In practice, there are only a
few blocks you’ll ever use with combine:</p>

<p>These blocks take the sum of the list items, take their product, string
them into one word, combine them into a sentence (with spaces between
items), see if all items of a list of Booleans are true, see if any of
the items is true, find the smallest, or find the largest.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image585.png" alt="" />{width=”6.279166666666667in”
height=”0.37569444444444444in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image586.png" alt="" />{width=”3.8680555555555554in”
height=”0.3451388888888889in”}Why + but not −? It only makes sense to
combine list items using an <em>associative</em> function: one that doesn’t
care in what order the items are combined (left to right or right to
left). (2+3)+4 = 2+(3+4), but (2−3)−4 ≠ 2−(3−4).</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image587.png" alt="" />{width=”5.808333333333334in”
height=”1.1909722222222223in”}The functions map, keep, and find first
have an advanced mode with rarely-used features: If their function input
is given explicit input names (by clicking the arrowhead at the right
end of the gray ring; see page 69), then it will be called for each list
item with <em>three</em> inputs: the item’s value (as usual), the item’s
position in the input list (its index), and the entire input list. No
more than three input names can be used in this contex</p>

<p>{#section-2 .ListParagraph}</p>

<h2 id="table-view-vs-list-view">Table View vs. List View</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image588.png" alt="" />{width=”3.0993055555555555in”
height=”2.513888888888889in”}We mentioned earlier that there are two
ways of representing lists visually. For one-dimensional lists (lists
whose items are not themselves lists) the visual differences are small:</p>

<p>For one-dimensional lists, it’s not really the appearance that’s
important. What matters is that the <em>list view</em> allows very versatile
direct manipulation of the list through the picture: you can edit the
individual items, you can delete items by clicking the tiny buttons next
to each item, and you can add new items at the end by clicking the tiny
plus sign in the lower left corner. (You can just barely see that the
item deletion buttons have minus signs in them.) Even if you have
several watchers for the same list, all of them will be updated when you
change anything. On the other hand, this versatility comes at an
efficiency cost; a list view watcher for a long list would be way too
slow. As a partial workaround, the list view can only contain 100 items
at a time; the downward-pointing arrowhead opens a menu in which you can
choose which 100 to display.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image592.png" alt="" />{width=”1.2555555555555555in”
height=”0.9125in”}</p>

<p>By contrast, because it doesn’t allow direct editing, the <em>table view</em>
watcher can hold hundreds of thousands of items and still scroll through
them efficiently. The table view has flatter graphics for the items to
remind you that they’re not clickable to edit the values.</p>

<p>Right-clicking on a list watcher (in either form) gives you the option
to switch to the other form. The right-click menu also offers an open in
dialog… option that opens an <em>offstage</em> table view watcher, because
the watchers can take up a lot of stage space that may make it hard to
see what your program is actually doing. Once the offstage dialog box is
open, you can close the stage watcher. There’s an OK button on the
offstage dialog to close it if you want. Or you can right-click it to
make <em>another</em> offstage watcher, which is useful if you want to watch
two parts of the list at once by having each watcher scrolled to a
different place.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image538.png" alt="" />{width=”5.888888888888889in”
height=”1.0486111111111112in”}Table view is the default if the list has
more than 100 items, or if any of the first ten items of the list are
lists, in which case it makes a very different-looking two-dimensional
picture:</p>

<p>In this format, the column of red items has been replaced by a
spreadsheet-looking display. For short, wide lists, this display makes
the content of the list very clear. A vertical display, with much of the
space taken up by the “machinery” at the bottom of each sublist, would
make it hard to show all the text at once. (The pedagogic cost is that
the structure is no longer explicit; we can’t tell just by looking that
this is a list of row-lists, rather than a list of column-lists or a
primitive two-dimensional array type. But you can choose list view to
see the structure.)</p>

<p>Beyond such simple cases, in which every item of the main list is a list
of the same length, it’s important to keep in mind that the design of
table view has to satisfy two goals, not always in agreement: (1) a
visually compelling display of two-dimensional arrays, and (2) highly
efficient display generation, so that Snap<em>!</em> can handle very large
lists, since “big data” is an important topic of study. To meet the
first goal perfectly in the case of “ragged right” arrays in which
sublists can have different lengths, Snap<em>!</em> would scan the entire list
to find the maximum width before displaying anything, but that would
violate the second goal.</p>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> uses the simplest possible compromise between the two goals: It
examines only the first ten items of the list to decide on the format.
If none of those are lists, or they’re all lists of one item, and the
overall length is no more than 100, list view is used. If the any of
first ten items is a list, then table view is used, and the number of
columns in the table is equal to the largest number of items among the
first ten items (sublists) of the main list.</p>

<p>Table views open with standard values for the width and height of a
cell, regardless of the actual data. You can change these values by
dragging the column letters or row numbers. Each column has its own
width, but changing the height of a row changes the height for all rows.
(This distinction is based not on the semantics of rows vs. columns, but
on the fact that a constant row height makes scrolling through a large
list more efficient.) Shift-dragging a column label will change the
width of that column.</p>

<p>If you tried out the adjustments in the previous paragraph, you may have
noticed that a column letter turns into a number when you hover over it.
Labeling rows and columns differently makes cell references such as
“cell 4B” unambiguous; you don’t have to have a convention about whether
to say the row first or the column first. (“Cell B4” is the same as
“cell 4B.”) On the other hand, to extract a value from column B in your
program, you have to say item 2 of, not item B of. So it’s useful to be
able to find out a column number by hovering over its letter.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image596.png" alt="" />{width=”3.817361111111111in”
height=”0.8111111111111111in”}Any value that can appear in a program can
be displayed in a table cell:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image597.png" alt="" />{width=”4.336805555555555in”
height=”2.104861111111111in”}This display shows that the standard cell
dimensions may not be enough for large value images. By expanding the
entire speech balloon and then the second column and all the rows, we
can make the result fit:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image601.png" alt="" />{width=”3.3409722222222222in”
height=”0.5770833333333333in”}But we make an exception for cases in
which the value in a cell is a list (so that the entire table is
three-dimensional). Because lists are visually very big, we don’t try to
fit the entire value in a cell:</p>

<p>Even if you expand the size of the cells, Snap<em>!</em> will not display
sublists of sublists in table view. There are two ways to see these
inner sublists: You can switch to list view, or you can double-click on
a list icon in the table to open a dialog box showing just that
sub-sub-list in table view.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image602.png" alt="" />{width=”3.3541666666666665in”
height=”0.6944444444444444in”}One last detail: If the first item of a
list is a list (so table view is used), but a later item <em>isn’t</em> a list,
that later item will be displayed on a red background, like an item of a
single-column list:</p>

<p>So, in particular, if only the first item is a list, the display will
look almost like a one-column display.</p>

<h3 id="comma-separated-values">Comma-Separated Values</h3>

<p>Spreadsheet and database programs generally offer the option to export
their data as CSV (comma-separated values lists. You can import these
files into Snap<em>!</em> and turn them into tables (lists of lists), and you
can export tables in CSV format. Snap<em>!</em> recognizes a CSV file by the
extension .csv in its filename.</p>

<p>A CSV file has one line per table row, with the fields separated by
commas within a row:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image603.png" alt="" />{width=”5.0in”
height=”2.6743055555555557in”}John,Lennon,rhythm guitar</p>

<p>Paul,McCartney,bass guitar</p>

<p>George,Harrison,lead guitar</p>

<p>Ringo,Starr,drums</p>

<p>Here’s what the corresponding table looks like:</p>

<p>Here’s how to read a spreadsheet into Snap<em>!</em>:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image607.png" alt="" />{width=”1.2083333333333333in”
height=”0.2708333333333333in”}1. Make a variable with a watcher on
stage:</p>

<p>2. Right-click on the watcher and choose the “import” option. (If the
variable’s value is already a list, be sure to click on the outside
border of the watcher; there is a different menu if you click on the
list itself.) Select the file with your csv data.</p>

<p>3. There is no 3; that’s it! Snap<em>!</em> will notice that the name of the
file you’re importing is something.csv and will turn the text into a
list of lists automatically.</p>

<p>Or, even easier, just drag and drop the file from your desktop onto the
Snap<em>!</em> window, and Snap<em>!</em> will automatically create a variable named
after the file and import the data into it.</p>

<p>If you actually want to import the raw CSV data into a variable, either
change the file extension to .txt before loading it, or choose “raw
data” instead of “import” in the watcher menu.</p>

<p>If you want to export a list, put a variable watcher containing the list
on the stage, right-click its border, and choose “Export.” (Don’t
right-click an item instead of the border; that gives a different menu.)</p>

<h3 id="multi-dimensional-lists-and-json">Multi-dimensional lists and JSON</h3>

<p>CSV format is easy to read, but works only for one- or two-dimensional
lists. If you have a list of lists of lists, Snap<em>!</em> will instead export
your list as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file. I modified my
list:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image608.png" alt="" />{width=”6.333333333333333in”
height=”0.4479166666666667in”}and then exported again, getting this
file:</p>

<p>[["John","Lennon","rhythm
guitar"],[["James","Paul"],"McCartney","bass
guitar"],["George","Harrison","lead
guitar"],["Ringo","Starr","drums"]]</p>

<p>You can also import lists, including tables, from a .json file. (And you
can import plain text from a .txt file.) Drag and drop works for these
formats also.</p>

<h2 id="hyperblocks">Hyperblocks</h2>

<p>A <em>scalar</em> is anything other than a list. The name comes from
mathematics, where it means a magnitude without direction, as opposed to
a vector, which points toward somewhere. A scalar function is one whose
domain and range are scalars, so all the arithmetic operations are
scalar functions, but so are the text ones such as letter and the
Boolean ones such as not.</p>

<p>The major new feature in Snap<em>!</em> 6.0 is that the domain and range of
most scalar function blocks is extended to multi-dimensional lists, with
the underlying scalar function applied termwise:</p>

height=”0.6944444444444444in”}Mathematicians, note in the last example
above that the result is just a termwise application of the underlying
function (7×3, 8×5, etc.), <em>not</em> matrix multiplication. See Appendix B
for that. For a dyadic (two-input) function, if the lengths don’t agree,
the length of the result (in each dimension) is the length of the
shorter input:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image613.png" alt="" />{width=”6.791666666666667in”
height=”0.8680555555555556in”}However, if the <em>number of dimensions</em>
differs in the two inputs, then the number of dimensions in the result
agrees with the <em>higher-</em>dimensional input; the lower-dimensional one is
used repeatedly in the missing dimension(s):</p>

<p>(7×6. 8×10, 1×20, <em>40</em>×<em>6, 20</em>×<em>10,</em> etc.). In particular, a <em>scalar</em>
input is paired with every scalar in the other input:</p>

height=”1.5180555555555555in”}One important motivation for this feature
is how it simplifies and speeds up media computation, as in this
shifting of the Alonzo costume to be bluer:</p>

height=”1.0486111111111112in”}Each pixel of the result has ¾ of its
original red and green, and three times its original blue (with its
transparency unchanged). By putting some sliders on the stage, you can
play with colors dynamically:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image621.png" alt="" />{width=”1.0298611111111111in”

height=”0.2in”}There are a few naturally scalar functions that have
already had specific meanings when applied to lists and therefore are
not hyperblocks: = and identical to (because they compare entire
structures, not just scalars, always reporting a single Boolean result),
and and or (because they don’t evaluate their second input at all if the
first input determines the result), join (because it converts non-scalar
(and other non-text) inputs to text string form), and is a (type)
(because it applies to its input as a whole). Blocks whose inputs are
“natively” lists, such as and , are never hyperblocks.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image622.png" alt="" />{width=”5.239583333333333in”

height=”0.2475in”}The reshape block takes a list (of any depth) as its
first input, and then takes zero or more sizes along the dimensions of
an array. In the example it will report a table (a matrix) of four rows
and three columns. If no sizes are given, the result is an empty list.
Otherwise, the cells of the specified shape are filled with the atomic
values from the input list. If more values are needed than provided, the
block starts again at the head of the list, using values more than once.
If more values are provided than needed, the extras are ignored; this
isn’t an error.</p>

to preserve its pre-hyperblock meaning and also provide a useful
behavior when given a list as its first (index) input:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If the index is a number, then item of reports the indicated

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the index is a list of numbers (no sublists), then item of
reports a list of the indicated top-level items (rows, in a matrix;
a straightforward hyperization): <img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image624.png" alt="Macintosh

height=”1.8583333333333334in”}The length of block is extended to provide
various ways of looking at the shape and contents of a list. The options
other than length are mainly useful for <em>lists of lists,</em> to any depth.
These new options work well with hyperblocks and the APL library.
(Examples are on the next page.)</p>

<p>length: reports the number of (toplevel) items in the list, as always.</p>

<p>rank: reports the number of <em>dimensions</em> of the list, i.e., the maximum
depth of lists of lists of lists of lists. (That example would be rank
4.)</p>

<p>dimensions: reports a list of numbers, each of which is the maximum
length in one dimension, so a spreadsheet of 1000 records, each with 4
fields, would report the list [1000 4].</p>

<p>flatten: reports a flat, one-dimensional list containing the <em>atomic</em>
(non-list) items anywhere in the input list.</p>

<p>columns: reports a list in which the rows and columns of the input list
are interchanged, so the shape of the transpose of a shape [1000 4]
list would be [4 1000]. This option works only for lists whose rank is
at most 2. The name reflects the fact that the toplevel items of the
reported table are the columns of the original table.</p>

<p>reverse: reports a list in which the (toplevel) items of the input list
are in reverse order.</p>

<p>The remaining three options report a (generally multi-line) text string.
The input list may not include any atomic (non-list) data other than
text or numbers. The lines option is intended for use with rank-one
lists of text strings; it reports a string in which each list item
becomes a line of text. You can think of it as the opposite of the split
by line block. The csv option (comma-separated values) is intended for
rank-two lists that represent a spreadsheet or other tabular data. Each
item of the input list should be a list of atoms; the block reports a
text string in which each item of the big list becomes a line of text in
which the items of that sublist are separated by commas. The json option
is for lists of any rank; it reports a text string in which the list
structure is explicitly represented using square brackets. These are the
opposites of split by csv and split by json.</p>

height=”6.733522528433946in”}</p>

<p>The idea of extending the domain and range of scalar functions to
include arrays comes from the language APL. (All the great programming
languages are based on mathematical ideas. Our primary ancestors are
Smalltalk, based on models, and Lisp, based on lambda calculus. Prolog,
a great language not (so far) influencing Snap<em>!</em>, is based on logic.
And APL, now joining our family, is based on linear algebra, which
studies vectors and matrices. Those <em>other</em> programming languages are
based on the weaknesses of computer hardware.) Hyperblocks are not the
whole story about APL, which also has mixed-domain functions and higher
order functions. Some of what’s missing is provided in the APL library.
(See Appendix B.)</p>

<h2 id="scratchs-type-notation">Scratch’s Type Notation</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image654.png" alt="" />{width=”1.375in”
height=”0.2125in”}Prior to version 3, Scratch block inputs came in two
types: Text-or-number type and Number type. The former is indicated by a
rectangular box, the latter by a rounded box: . A third Scratch type,
Boolean (true/false), can be used in certain Control blocks with
hexagonal slots.</p>

<p>The Snap<em>!</em> types are an expanded collection including Procedure, List,
and Object types. Note that, with the exception of Procedure types, all
of the input type shapes are just reminders to the user of what the
block expects; they are not enforced by the language.</p>

<h2 id="width25833333333333335in-height16041666666666667inthe-snap-input-type-dialog"><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image655.png" alt="" />{width=”2.5833333333333335in” height=”1.6041666666666667in”}The Snap<em>!</em> Input Type Dialog</h2>

<p>In the Block Editor input name dialog, there is a right-facing arrowhead
after the “Input name” option:</p>

<p>Clicking that arrowhead opens the “long” input name dialog:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image657.png" alt="" />{width=”5.170833333333333in”
height=”4.135416666666667in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image658.png" alt="" />{width=”0.19791666666666666in”
height=”0.19791666666666666in”}There are twelve input type shapes, plus
three mutually exclusive modifiers, listed in addition to the basic
choice between title text and an input name. The default type, the one
you get if you don’t choose anything else, is “Any,” meaning that this
input slot is meant to accept any value of any type. If the size input
in your block should be an oval-shaped numeric slot rather than a
generic rectangle, click “Number.”</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image659.png" alt="" />{width=”6.822222222222222in”
height=”2.7569444444444446in”}The arrangement of the input types is
systematic. As the pictures on this and the next page show, each row of
types is a category, and parts of each column form a category.
Understanding the arrangement will make it a little easier to find the
type you want.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image658.png" alt="" />{width=”0.13194444444444445in”
height=”0.13194444444444445in”}The second row of input types contains
the ones found in Scratch: Number, Any, and Boolean. (The reason these
are in the second row rather than the ﬁrst will become clear when we
look at the column arrangement.) The ﬁrst row contains the new Snap<em>!</em>
types other than procedures: Object, Text, and List. The last two rows
are the types related to procedures, discussed more fully below.</p>

<p>The List type is used for ﬁrst class lists, discussed in Chapter IV
above. The red rectangles inside the input slot are meant to resemble
the appearance of lists as Snap<em>!</em> displays them on the stage: each
element in a red rectangle.</p>

<p>The Object type is for sprites, costumes, sounds, and similar data
types.</p>

<p>The Text type is really just a variant form of the Any type, using a
shape that suggests a text input.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="procedure-types">Procedure Types</h3>

<p>Although the procedure types are discussed more fully later, they are
the key to understanding the column arrangement in the input types. Like
Scratch, Snap<em>!</em> has three block shapes: jigsaw-piece for command
blocks, oval for reporters, and hexagonal for predicates. (A <em>predicate</em>
is a reporter that always reports true or false.) In Snap<em>!</em> these
blocks are ﬁrst class data; an input to a block can be of Command type,
Reporter type, or Predicate type. Each of these types is directly below
the type of value that that kind of block reports, except for Commands,
which don’t report a value at all. Thus, oval Reporters are related to
the Any type, while hexagonal Predicates are related to the Boolean
(true or false) type.</p>

<p>The unevaluated procedure types in the fourth row are explained in
Section VI.E below. In one handwavy sentence, they combine the <em>meaning</em>
of the procedure types with the <em>appearance</em> of the reported value types
two rows higher. (Of course, this isn’t quite right for the C-shaped
command input type, since commands don’t
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image660.png" alt="" />{width=”3.6458333333333335in”
height=”3.113888888888889in”}report values. But you’ll see later that
it’s true in spirit.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image661.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6805555555555556in”
height=”0.9409722222222222in”}Certain primitive blocks have <em>pulldown</em>
inputs, either <em>read-only,</em> like the input to the touching block:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image662.png" alt="" />{width=”1.9020833333333333in”
height=”1.3229166666666667in”}(indicated by the input slot being the
same (cyan, in this case) color as the body of the block), or
<em>writeable,</em> like the input to the point in direction block:</p>

<p>(indicated by the white input slot), which means that the user can type
in an arbitrary input instead of using the pulldown menu.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image663.png" alt="" />{width=”0.8326388888888889in”
height=”0.6527777777777778in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image658.png" alt="" />{width=”0.13194444444444445in”
height=”0.13194444444444445in”}Custom blocks can also have such inputs.
To make a pulldown input, open the long form input dialog, choose a text
type (Any, Text, or Number) and click the icon in the bottom right
corner, or control/right-click in the dialog. You will see this menu:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image664.png" alt="" />{width=”3.076388888888889in”
height=”1.875in”}Click the read-only checkbox if you want a read-only
pulldown input. Then from the same menu, choose options… to get this
dialog box:</p>

<p>Each line in the text box represents one menu item. If the line does not
contain any of the characters =~{} then the text is both what’s shown
in the menu and the value of the input if that entry is chosen.</p>

<p>If the line contains an equal sign =, then the text to the left of the
equal sign is shown in the menu, and the text to the right is what
appears in the input slot if that entry is chosen, and is also the value
of the input as seen by the procedure.</p>

<p>If the line consists of a tilde ~, then it represents a separator (a
horizontal line) in the menu, used to divide long menus into visible
categories. There should be nothing else on the line. This separator is
not choosable, so there is no input value corresponding to it.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image665.png" alt="" />{width=”7.5in”
height=”3.2416666666666667in”}If the line ends with the two characters
equal sign and open brace ={, then it represents a <em>submenu.</em> The text
before the equal sign is a name for the submenu, and will be displayed
in the menu with an arrowhead ► at the end of the line. This line is not
clickable, but hovering the mouse over it displays the submenu next to
the original menu. A line containing a close brace } ends the submenu;
nothing else should be on that line. Submenus may be nested to arbitrary
depth.</p>

<p>###</p>

<p>Alternatively, instead of giving a menu listing as described above, you
can put a JavaScript function that returns the desired menu in the
textbox. This is an experimental feature and requires that JavaScript be
enabled in the Settings menu.<br />
It is also possible to get the special menus used in some primitive
blocks, by choosing from the menu submenu: broadcast messages, sprites
and stage, costumes, sounds, variables that can be set in this scope,
the play note piano keyboard, or the point in direction 360° dial.
Finally, you can make the input box accept more than one line of text
(that is, text including a newline character) from the special submenu,
either “multi-line” for regular
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image669.png" alt="" />{width=”0.6041666666666666in”
height=”0.3194444444444444in”}text or “code” for monospace-font computer
code.</p>

height=”0.2569444444444444in”}If the input type is something other than
text, then clicking the button will instead show this menu:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image672.png" alt="" />{width=”7.5in”
height=”2.6277777777777778in”}As an example, we want to make this block:
The second input must be a read-only object menu:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image678.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6388888888888888in”

height=”1.2944444444444445in”}The “Multiple inputs” option: The list
block introduced earlier accepts any number of inputs to specify the
items of the new list. To allow this, Snap<em>!</em> introduces the arrowhead
notation () that expands and contracts the block, adding and removing
input slots. (Shift-clicking on an arrowhead adds or removes three input
slots at once.) Custom blocks made by the Snap<em>!</em> user have that
capability, too. If you choose the “Multiple inputs” button, then
arrowheads will appear after the input slot in the block. More or fewer
slots (as few as zero) may be used. When the block runs, all of the
values in all of the slots for this input name are collected into a
list, and the value of the input as seen inside the script is that list
of values:</p>

<p>The ellipsis (…) in the orange input slot name box in the prototype
indicates a multiple or <em>variadic</em> input.</p>

<p>The third category, “Upvar - make internal variable visible to caller,”
isn’t really an input at all, but rather a sort of output from the block
to its user. It appears as an orange variable oval in the block, rather
than as an input slot. Here’s an example; the uparrow (<strong>↑</strong>) in the
prototype indicates this kind of internal variable name:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image681.png" alt="" />{width=”5.901388888888889in”
height=”0.53125in”}</p>

<p>The variable i (in the block on the right above) can be dragged from the
for block into the blocks used in its C-shaped command slot. Also, by
clicking on the orange i, the user can change the name of the variable
as seen in the calling script (although the name hasn’t changed inside
the block’s definition). This kind of variable is called an <em>upvar</em> for
short, because it is passed <em>upward</em> from the custom block to the script
that uses it.</p>

<p>Note about the example: for is a primitive block, but it doesn’t need to
be. You’re about to see (next chapter) how it can be written in Snap<em>!</em>.
Just give it a different name to avoid confusion, such as my for as
above.</p>

<h3 id="prototype-hints">Prototype Hints</h3>

<p>We have mentioned three notations that can appear in an input slot in
the prototype to remind you of what kind of input this is. Here is the
complete list of such notations:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image687.png" alt="" />{width=”1.21875in”
height=”0.23472222222222222in”}Some primitive blocks have symbols as
part of the block name: . Custom blocks can use symbols too. In the
Block Editor, click the plus sign in the prototype at the point where
you want to insert the symbol. Then click the title text picture below
the text box that’s expecting an input slot name. The dialog will then
change to look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image688.png" alt="" />{width=”1.2444444444444445in”
height=”0.26666666666666666in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image689.png" alt="" />{width=”2.0347222222222223in”
height=”1.2638888888888888in”}The important part to notice is the
arrowhead that has appeared at the right end of the text box. Click it
to see the menu shown here at the left.</p>

<p>Choose one of the symbols. The result will have the symbol you want: The
available symbols are, pretty much, the ones that are used in Snap<em>!</em>
icons.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image690.png" alt="" />{width=”2.0347222222222223in”
height=”1.2638888888888888in”}But I’d like the arrow symbol bigger, and
yellow, so I edit its name:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image691.png" alt="" />{width=”1.1979166666666667in”
height=”0.2708333333333333in”}This makes the symbol 1.5 times as big as
the letters in the block text, using a color with red-green-blue values
of 255-255-150 (each between 0 and 255). Here’s the result:</p>

<p>The size and color controls can also be used with text:
$foo-8-255-120-0 will make a huge orange “foo.”</p>

<p>Note the last entry in the symbol menu: “new line.” This can be used in
a block with many inputs to control where the text continues on another
line, instead of letting Snap<em>!</em> choose the line break itself.</p>

<h1 id="procedures-as-data">Procedures as Data</h1>

height=”1.5833333333333333in”}In the for block example above, the input
named action has been declared as type “Command (C-shaped)”; that’s why
the finished block is C-shaped. But how does the block actually tell
Snap<em>!</em> to carry out the commands inside the C-slot? Here is a simple
version of the block script:</p>

<p>This is simplified because it assumes, without checking, that the ending
value is greater than the starting value; if not, the block should
(depending on the designer’s purposes) either not run at all, or change
the variable by −1 for each repetition instead of by 1.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image693.png" alt="" />{width=”0.5in”
height=”0.15625in”}The important part of this script is the run block
near the end. This is a Snap<em>!</em> built-in command block that takes a
Command-type value (a script) as its input, and carries out its
instructions. (In this example, the value of the input is the script
that the user puts in the C-slot of the my for block.) There is a
similar call reporter block for invoking a Reporter or Predicate block.
The call and run blocks are at the heart of Snap<em>!</em>’s ﬁrst class
procedure feature; they allow scripts and blocks to be used as data—in
this example, as an input to a block—and eventually carried out under
control of the user’s program.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image694.png" alt="" />{width=”7.065972222222222in”
height=”1.65625in”}Here’s another example, this time using a
Reporter-type input in a map block (see page 50):</p>

<p>Here we are calling the Reporter “multiply by 10” three times, once with
each item of the given list as its input, and collecting the results as
a list. (The reported list will always be the same length as the input
list.) Note that the multiplication block has two inputs, but here we
have specified a particular value for one of them (10), so the call
block knows to use the input value given to it just to fill the other
(empty) input slot in the multiplication block. In the my map
definition, the input function is declared to be type Reporter, and data
is of type List.</p>

<h3 id="callrun-with-inputs">Call/Run with inputs</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image698.png" alt="" />{width=”1.8125in”
height=”0.20833333333333334in”}The call block (like the run block) has a
right arrowhead at the end; clicking on it adds the phrase “with inputs”
and then a slot into which an input can be inserted:</p>

<p>If the left arrowhead is used to remove the last input slot, the “with
inputs” disappears also. The right arrowhead can be clicked as many
times as needed for the number of inputs required by the reporter block
being called.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image699.png" alt="" />{width=”2.7291666666666665in”
height=”0.31805555555555554in”}If the number of inputs given to call
(not counting the Reporter-type input that comes first) is the same as
the number of empty input slots, then the empty slots are filled from
left to right with the given input values. If call is given exactly one
input, then <em>every</em> empty input slot of the called block is filled with
the same value:</p>

<p>If the number of inputs provided is neither one nor the number of empty
slots, then there is no automatic filling of empty slots. (Instead you
must use explicit parameters in the ring, as discussed in Section C
below.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image700.png" alt="" />{width=”6.990277777777778in”
height=”0.6979166666666666in”}An even more important thing to notice
about these examples is the <em>ring</em> around the Reporter-type input slots
in call and map above. This notation indicates that <em>the block itself,</em>
not the number or other value that the block would report when called,
is the input. If you want to use a block itself in a non-Reporter-type
(e.g., Any-type) input slot, you can enclose it explicitly in a ring,
found at the top of the Operators palette.</p>

<p>As a shortcut, if you right-click or control-click on a block (such as
the + block in this example), one of the choices in the menu that
appears is “ringify” and/or “unringify.” The ring indicating a
Reporter-type or Predicate-type input slot is essentially the same idea
for reporters as the C-shaped input slot with which you’re already
familiar; with a C-shaped slot, it’s <em>the script</em> you put in the slot
that becomes the input to the C-shaped block.</p>

<p>There are three ring shapes. All are oval on the outside, indicating
that the ring reports a value, the block or script inside it, but the
inside shapes are command, reporter, or predicate, indicating what kind
of block or script is expected. Sometimes you want to put something more
complicated than a single reporter inside a reporter ring; if so, you
can use a script, but the script must report a value, as in a custom
reporter definition.</p>

<h3 id="variables-in-ring-slots">Variables in Ring Slots</h3>

<p>Note that the run block in the definition of the my for block (page 65)
doesn’t have a ring around its input variable action. When you drag a
variable into a ringed input slot, you generally <em>do</em> want to use <em>the
value of</em> the variable, which will be the block or script you’re trying
to run or call, rather than the orange variable reporter itself. So
Snap<em>!</em> automatically removes the ring in this case. If you ever do want
to use the variable <em>block itself,</em> rather than the value of the
variable, as a Procedure-type input, you can drag the variable into the
input slot, then control-click or right-click it and choose “ringify”
from the menu that appears. (Similarly, if you ever want to call a
function that will report a block to use as the input, such as item 1 of
applied to a list <em>of blocks,</em> you can choose “unringify” from the menu.
Almost all the time, though, Snap<em>!</em> does what you mean without help.)</p>

<h2 id="writing-higher-order-procedures">Writing Higher Order Procedures</h2>

<p>A <em>higher order procedure</em> is one that takes another procedure as an
input, or that reports a procedure. In this document, the word
“procedure” encompasses scripts, individual blocks, and nested
reporters. (Unless specified otherwise, “reporter” includes predicates.
When the word is capitalized inside a sentence, it means specifically
oval-shaped blocks. So, “nested reporters” includes predicates, but “a
Reporter-type input” doesn’t.)</p>

<p>Although an Any-type input slot (what you get if you use the small
input-name dialog box) will accept a procedure input, it doesn’t
automatically ring the input as described above. So the declaration of
Procedure-type inputs makes the use of your custom higher order block
much more convenient.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image708.png" alt="" />{width=”2.375in”
height=”1.3541666666666667in”}Why would you want a block to take a
procedure as input? This is actually not an obscure thing to do; the
primitive conditional and looping blocks (the C-shaped ones in the
Control palette) take a script as input. Users just don’t usually think
about it in those terms! We could write the repeat block as a custom
block this way, if Snap<em>!</em> didn’t already have one:</p>

<p>The lambda (λ) next to action in the prototype indicates that this is a
C-shaped block, and that the script enclosed by the C when the block is
used is the input named action in the body of the script. The only way
to make sense of the variable action is to understand that its value is
a script.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image509.png" alt="" />{width=”2.5833333333333335in”
height=”1.6041666666666667in”}To declare an input to be Procedure-type,
open the input name dialog as usual, and click on the arrowhead:</p>

<p>Then, in the long dialog, choose the appropriate Procedure type. The
third row of input types has a ring in the shape of each block type
(jigsaw for Commands, oval for Reporters, and hexagonal for Predicates).
In practice, though, in the case of Commands it’s more common to choose
the C-shaped slot on the fourth row, because this “container” for
command scripts is familiar to Scratch users. Technically the C-shaped
slot is an <em>unevaluated</em> procedure type, something discussed in Section
E below. The two Command-related input types (inline and C-shaped) are
connected by the fact that if a variable, an item (#) of [list]
block, or a custom Reporter block is dropped onto a C-shaped slot of a
custom block, it turns into an inline slot, as in the repeater block’s
recursive call above. (Other built-in Reporters can’t report scripts, so
they aren’t accepted in a C-shaped slot.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image658.png" alt="" />{width=”0.19791666666666666in”

height=”2.75455271216098in”}<br />
Why would you ever choose an inline Command slot rather than a C shape?
Other than the run block
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image710.png" alt="" />{width=”2.1145833333333335in”
height=”0.46875in”}discussed below, the only case I can think of is
something like the C/C++/Java for loop, which actually has <em>three</em>
command script inputs (and one predicate input), only one of which is
the “featured” loop body:</p>

<p>Okay, now that we have procedures as inputs to our blocks, how do we use
them? We use the blocks run (for commands) and call (for reporters). The
run block’s script input is an inline ring, not C-shaped, because we
anticipate that it will be rare to use a specific, literal script as the
input. Instead, the input will generally be a variable whose <em>value</em> is
a script.</p>

<p>The run and call blocks have arrowheads at the end that can be used to
open slots for inputs to the called procedures. How does Snap<em>!</em> know
where to use those inputs? If the called procedure (block or script) has
empty input slots, Snap<em>!</em> “does the right thing.” This has several
possible meanings:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image711.png" alt="" />{width=”3.4479166666666665in”
height=”0.34405949256342955in”}1. If the number of empty slots is
exactly equal to the number of inputs provided, then Snap<em>!</em> fills the
empty slots from left to right:</p>

<p>2. If exactly one input is provided, Snap<em>!</em> will fill any number of
empty slots with it:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image712.png" alt="" />{width=”2.8020833333333335in”
height=”0.30694444444444446in”}</p>

<p>3. Otherwise, Snap<em>!</em> won’t fill any slots, because the user’s intention
is unclear.</p>

<p>If the user wants to override these rules, the solution is to use a ring
with explicit input names that can be put into the given block or script
to indicate how inputs are to be used. This will be discussed more fully
below.</p>

<h3 id="recursive-calls-to-multiple-input-blocks">Recursive Calls to Multiple-Input Blocks</h3>

<p>A relatively rare situation not yet considered here is the case of a
recursive block that has a variable number of inputs. Let’s say the user
of your project calls your block with five inputs one time, and 87
inputs another time. How do you write the recursive call to your block
when you don’t know how many inputs to give it? The answer is that you
collect the inputs in a list (recall that, when you declare an input
name to represent a variable number of inputs, your block sees those
inputs as a list of values in the first place), and then, in the
recursive call, you drop that input list <em>onto the arrowheads</em> that
indicate a variable-input slot, rather than onto the input slot:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image658.png" alt="" />{width=”0.13194444444444445in”
height=”0.13194444444444445in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image713.png" alt="" />{width=”2.501388888888889in”

height=”1.5972222222222223in”}<br />
Note that the halo you see while dragging onto the arrowheads is red
instead of white, and covers the input slot as well as the arrowheads.
And when you drop the expression onto the arrowheads, the words “input
list:” are added to the block text and the arrowheads disappear (in this
invocation only) to remind you that the list represents all of the
multiple inputs, not just a single input. The items in the list are
taken <em>individually</em> as inputs to the script. Since numbers is a list of
numbers, each individual item is a number, just what sizes wants. This
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image716.png" alt="" />{width=”6.8125in”
height=”1.7104166666666667in”}block will take any number of numbers as
inputs, and will make the sprite grow and shrink accordingly:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image722.png" alt="" />{width=”2.9583333333333335in”
height=”0.6875in”}The user of this block calls it with any number of
<em>individual numbers</em> as inputs. But inside the definition of the block,
all of those numbers form <em>a</em> <em>list</em> that has a single input name,
numbers. This recursive definition ﬁrst checks to make sure there are
any inputs at all. If so, it processes the ﬁrst input (item 1 of the
list), then it wants to make a recursive call with all but the ﬁrst
number. But sizes doesn’t take a list as input; it takes numbers as
inputs! So this would be wrong:</p>

height=”1.0395833333333333in”}The rings around Procedure-type inputs
have an arrowhead at the right. Clicking the arrowhead allows you to
give the inputs to a block or script explicit names, instead of using
empty input slots as we’ve done until now.</p>

<p>The names #1, #2, etc. are provided by default, but you can change a
name by clicking on its orange oval in the input names list. Be careful
not to <em>drag</em> the oval when clicking; that’s how you use the input
inside the ring. The names of the input variables are called the <em>formal
parameters</em> of the encapsulated procedure.</p>

height=”0.45416666666666666in”}Here’s a simple but contrived example
using explicit names to control which input goes where inside the ring:</p>

<p>Here we just want to put one of the inputs into two different slots. If
we left all three slots empty, Snap<em>!</em> would not fill any of them,
because the number of inputs provided (2) would not match the number of
empty slots (3).</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image732.png" alt="" />{width=”4.679861111111111in”
height=”3.0180555555555557in”}Here is a more realistic, much more
advanced example:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image733.png" alt="" />{width=”4.347222222222222in”
height=”1.4027777777777777in”}</p>

<p>This is the definition of a block that takes any number of lists, and
reports the list of all possible combinations of one item from each
list. The important part for this discussion is that near the bottom
there are two <em>nested</em> calls to map, the higher order function that
applies an input function to each item of an input list. In the inner
block, the function being mapped is in front of, and that block takes
two inputs. The second, the empty List-type slot, will get its value in
each call from an item of the inner map’s list input. But there is no
way for the outer map to communicate values to empty slots of the in
front of block. We must give an explicit name, newitem, to the value
that the outer map is giving to the inner one, then drag that variable
into the in front of block.</p>

<p>By the way, once the called block provides names for its inputs, Snap<em>!</em>
will not automatically fill empty slots, on the theory that the user has
taken control. In fact, that’s another reason you might want to name the
inputs explicitly: to stop Snap<em>!</em> from filling a slot that should
really remain empty.</p>

<h2 id="procedures-as-data-1">Procedures as Data</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image734.png" alt="" />{width=”5.1875in”
height=”1.65625in”}Here’s an example of a situation in which a procedure
must be explicitly marked as data by pulling a ring from the Operators
palette and putting the procedure (block or script) inside it:</p>

<p>Here, we are making a list of procedures. But the list block accepts
inputs of any type, so its input slots are not ringed. We must say
explicitly that we want the block <em>itself</em> as the input, rather than
whatever value would result from evaluating the block.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image735.png" alt="" />{width=”3.8333333333333335in”
height=”0.84375in”}Besides the list block in the example above, other
blocks into which you may want to put procedures are set (to set the
value of a variable to a procedure), say and think (to display a
procedure to the user), and report (for a reporter that reports a
procedure):</p>

<h2 id="special-forms">Special Forms</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image736.png" alt="" />{width=”2.4993055555555554in”
height=”0.27847222222222223in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image737.png" alt="" />{width=”2.402083333333333in”
height=”1.4270833333333333in”}The primitive if else block has two
C-shaped command slots and chooses one or the other depending on a
Boolean test. Because Scratch doesn’t emphasize functional programming,
it lacks a corresponding reporter block to choose between two
expressions. Snap<em>!</em> has one, but we could write our own:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image738.png" alt="" />{width=”4.291666666666667in”
height=”0.8486111111111111in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image739.png" alt="" />{width=”3.818985126859143in”
height=”0.27433070866141734in”}Our block works for these simple
examples, but if we try to use it in writing a recursive operator, it’ll
fail:</p>

<p>The problem is that when any block is called, all of its inputs are
computed (evaluated) before the block itself runs. The block itself
knows only the values of its inputs, not what expressions were used to
compute them. In particular, all of the inputs to our if then else block
are evaluated ﬁrst thing. That means that even in the base case,
factorial will try to call itself recursively, causing an infinite loop.
We need our if then else block to be able to select only one of the two
alternatives to be evaluated.</p>

<p>We have a mechanism to allow that: declare the then and else inputs to
be of type Reporter rather than type Any. Then, when calling the block,
those inputs will be enclosed in a ring so that the expressions
themselves, rather than their values, become the inputs:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image740.png" alt="" />{width=”1.1145833333333333in”
height=”0.6979166666666666in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image741.png" alt="" />{width=”4.520833333333333in”

height=”1.5104166666666667in”}</p>

<p>In this version, the program works, with no infinite loop. But we’ve
paid a heavy price: this reporter-if is no longer as intuitively obvious
as the Scratch command-if. You have to know about procedures as data,
about rings, and about a trick to get a constant value in a ringed slot.
(The id block implements the identity function, which reports its
input.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> We need it because rings take only reporters as input, not
numbers.) What we’d like is a reporter-if that <em>behaves</em> like this one,
delaying the evaluation of its inputs, but <em>looks</em> like our ﬁrst
version, which was easy to use except that it didn’t work.</p>

<p>Such blocks are indeed possible. A block that seems to take a simple
expression as input, but delays the evaluation of that input by wrapping
an “invisible ring” around it (and, if necessary, an id-like
transformation of constant data into constant functions) is called a
<em>special form</em>. To turn our if block into a special form, we edit the
block’s prototype, declaring the inputs yes and no to be of type “Any
(unevaluated)” instead of type Reporter. The script for the block is
still that of the second version, including the use of call to evaluate
either yes or no but not both. But the slots appear as white Any-type
rectangles, not Reporter-type rings, and the factorial block will look
like our ﬁrst attempt.</p>

<p>In a special form’s prototype, the unevaluated input slot(s) are
indicated by a lambda (λ) next to the input name, just as if they were
declared as Procedure type. They <em>are</em> Procedure type, really; they’re
just disguised to the user of the block.</p>

<p>Special forms trade off implementor sophistication for user
sophistication. That is, you have to understand all about procedures as
data to make sense of the special form implementation of my if then
else. But any experienced Scratch programmer can <em>use</em> my if then else
without thinking at all about how it works internally.</p>

<h3 id="special-forms-in-scratch">Special Forms in Scratch</h3>

<p>Special forms are actually not a new invention in Snap<em>!</em>. Many of
Scratch’s conditional and looping blocks are really special forms. The
hexagonal input slot in the if block is a straightforward Boolean value,
because the value can be computed once, before the if block makes its
decision about whether or not to run its action input. But the forever
if, repeat until, and wait until blocks’ inputs can’t be Booleans; they
have to be of type “Boolean (unevaluated),” so that Scratch can evaluate
them over and over again. Since Scratch doesn’t have custom C‑shaped
blocks, it can afford to handwave away the distinction between evaluated
and unevaluated Booleans, but Snap<em>!</em> can’t. The pedagogic value of
special forms is proven by the fact that no Scratcher ever notices that
there’s anything strange about the way in which the hexagonal inputs in
the Control blocks are evaluated.</p>

<p>Also, the C-shaped slot familiar to Scratch users is an unevaluated
procedure type; you don’t have to use a ring to keep the commands in the
C-slot from being run before the C-shaped block is run. Those commands
themselves, not the result of running them, are the input to the
C-shaped Control block. (This is taken for granted by Scratch users,
especially because Scratchers don’t think of the contents of a C-slot as
an input at all.) This is why it makes sense that “C‑shaped” is on the
fourth row of types in the long form input dialog, with other
unevaluated types.</p>

<h1 id="object-oriented-programming-with-sprites">Object Oriented Programming with Sprites</h1>

<p>Object oriented programming is a style based around the abstraction
<em>object:</em> a collection of <em>data</em> and <em>methods</em> (procedures, which from
our point of view are just more data) that you interact with by sending
it a <em>message</em> (just a name, maybe in the form of a text string, and
perhaps additional inputs). The object responds to the message by
carrying out a method, which may or may not report a value back to the
asker. Some people emphasize the <em>data hiding</em> aspect of OOP (because
each object has local variables that other objects can access only by
sending request messages to the owning object) while others emphasize
the <em>simulation</em> aspect (in which each object abstractly represents
something in the world, and the interactions of objects in the program
model real interactions of real people or things). Data hiding is
important for large multi-programmer industrial projects, but for
Snap<em>!</em> users it’s the simulation aspect that’s important. Our approach
is therefore less restrictive than that of some other OOP languages; we
give objects easy access to each others’ data and methods.</p>

<p>Technically, object oriented programming rests on three legs: (1)
<em>Message passing:</em> There is a notation by which any object can send a
message to another object. (2) <em>Local state:</em> Each object can remember
the important past history of the computation it has performed.
(“Important” means that it need not remember every message it has
handled, but only the lasting effects of those messages that will affect
later computation.) (3) <em>Inheritance:</em> It would be impractical if each
individual object had to contain methods, many of them identical to
those of other objects, for all of the messages it can accept. Instead,
we need a way to say that this new object is just like that old object
except for a few differences, so that only those differences need be
programmed explicitly.</p>

<h2 id="first-class-sprites">First Class Sprites</h2>

<p>Like Scratch, Snap<em>!</em> comes with things that are natural objects: its
sprites. Each sprite can own local variables; each sprite has its own
scripts (methods). A Scratch animation is plainly a simulation of the
interaction of characters in a play. There are two ways in which Scratch
sprites are less versatile than the objects of an OOP language. First,
Scratch message passing is weak in three respects: Messages can only be
broadcast, not addressed to an individual sprite; messages can’t take
inputs; and methods can’t return values to their caller. Second, and
more basic, in the OOP paradigm objects are <em>data;</em> they can be the
value of a variable, an element of a list, and so on, but that’s not the
case for Scratch sprites.</p>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> sprites are ﬁrst class data. They can be created and deleted by
a script, stored in a variable or list, and sent messages individually.
The children of a sprite can inherit sprite-local variables, methods
(sprite-local procedures), and other attributes (e.g., x position).</p>

get access to sprites is the my reporter block. It has a dropdown-menu
input slot that, when clicked, gives access to all the sprites, plus the
stage. reports a single sprite, the one asking the question. reports a
list of all sprites other than the one asking the question. reports a
list of all sprites that are <em>near</em> the one asking—the ones that are
candidates for having collided with this one, for example. The my block
has many other options, discussed below. If you know the name of a
particular sprite, the object reporter will report the sprite itself.</p>

background.</p>

<h2 id="permanent-and-temporary-clones">Permanent and Temporary Clones</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image748.png" alt="" />{width=”1.5138888888888888in”
height=”0.19444444444444445in”}The block is used to create and report an
instance (a clone) of any sprite. (There is also a command version, for
historical reasons.) There are two different kinds of situations in
which clones are used. One is that you’ve made an example sprite and,
when you start the project, you want a fairly large number of
essentially identical sprites that behave like the example. (Hereafter
we’ll call the example sprite the “parent” and the others the
“children.”) Once the game or animation is over, you don’t need the
copies any more. (As we’ll see, “copies” is the wrong word because the
parent and the children <em>share</em> a lot of properties. That’s why we use
the word “clones” to describe the children rather than “copies.”) These
are <em>temporary</em> clones. They are automatically deleted when the user
presses either the green flag or the red stop sign. In Scratch 2.0 and
later, all clones are temporary.</p>

<p>The other kind of situation is what happens when you want
specializations of sprites. For example, let’s say you have a sprite
named Dog. It has certain behaviors, such as running up to a person who
comes near it. Now you decide that the family in your story really likes
dogs, so they adopt a lot of them. Some are cocker spaniels, who wag
their tails when they see you. Others are rottweilers, who growl at you
when they see you. So you make a clone of Dog, perhaps rename it Cocker
Spaniel, and give it a new costume and a script for what to do when
someone gets near. You make another clone of Dog, perhaps rename it
Rottweiler, and give it a new costume, etc. Then you make three clones
of Cocker Spaniel (so there are four altogether) and two clones of
Rottweiler. Maybe you hide the Dog sprite after all this, since it’s no
breed in particular. Each dog has its own position, special behaviors,
and so on. You want to save all of these dogs in the project. These are
<em>permanent</em> clones. In BYOB 3.1, the predecessor to Snap<em>!,</em> all clones
are permanent.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image748.png" alt="" />{width=”1.5138888888888888in”
height=”0.19444444444444445in”}One advantage of temporary clones is that
they don’t slow down Snap<em>!</em> even when you have a lot of them. (If
you’re curious, one reason is that permanent clones appear in the sprite
corral, where their pictures have to be updated to reflect the clone’s
current costume, direction, and so on.) We have tried to anticipate your
needs, as follows: When you make a clone in a script, using the block,
it is “born” temporary. But when you make a clone from the user
interface, for example by right-clicking on a sprite and choosing
“clone,” it is born permanent. The reason this makes sense is that you
don’t create 100 <em>kinds</em> of dogs automatically. Each kind has many
different characteristics, programmed by hand. But when your project is
running, it might create 100 rottweilers, and those will be identical
unless you change them in the program.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image749.png" alt="" />{width=”1.5138888888888888in”
height=”0.2569444444444444in”}You can change a temporary sprite to
permanent by right-clicking it and choosing “edit.” (It’s called “edit”
rather than, say, “permanent” because it also shifts the scripting area
to reflect that sprite, as if you’d pressed its button in the sprite
corral.) You can change a permanent sprite to temporary by
right-clicking it and choosing “release.” You can also change the status
of a clone in your program with with true or false as the second input.</p>

<h2 id="sending-messages-to-sprites">Sending Messages to Sprites</h2>

<p>The messages that a sprite accepts are the blocks in its palettes,
including both all-sprites and this-sprite-only blocks. (For custom
blocks, the corresponding methods are the scripts as seen in the Block
Editor.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image750.png" alt="" />{width=”5.702083333333333in”
height=”0.3611111111111111in”}The way to send a message to a sprite (or
the stage) is with the tell block (for command messages) or the ask
block (for reporter messages).</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image754.png" alt="" />{width=”6.236111111111111in”
height=”0.8055555555555556in”}A small point to note in the examples
above: all dropdown menus include an empty entry at the top, which can
be selected for use in higher order procedures like the for each and map
examples. Each of the sprites in my neighbors or my other sprites is
used to fill the blank space in turn.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image758.png" alt="" />{width=”5.164583333333334in”
height=”0.2847222222222222in”}By the way, if you want a list of <em>all</em>
the sprites, including this sprite, you can use either of these:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image762.png" alt="" />{width=”3.545138888888889in”
height=”0.8263888888888888in”}Tell and ask wait until the other sprite
has carried out its method before this sprite’s script continues. (That
has to be the case for ask, since we want to do something with the value
it reports.) So tell is analogous to broadcast and wait. Sometimes the
other sprite’s method may take a long time, or may even be a forever
loop, so you want the originating script to continue without waiting.
For this purpose we have the launch block:</p>

<p>Launch is analogous to broadcast without the “wait.”</p>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> 4.1, following BYOB 3.1, used an extension of the of block to
provide access to other sprites’ methods. That interface was designed
back when we were trying hard to avoid adding new primitive blocks; it
allowed us to write ask and tell as tool procedures in Snap<em>!</em> itself.
That technique still works, but is deprecated, because nobody understood
it, and now we have the more straightforward primitives.</p>

<h3 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image763.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6736111111111112in”
height=”1.4020833333333333in”}Suppose you have a Dog sprite with two
clones CockerSpaniel and PitBull. In the Dog sprite you define this
method (“For this sprite only” block):</p>

<p>Note the <em>loca</em>tion (map-pin) symbol before the block’s name. The symbol
is not part of the block title; it’s a visual reminder that this is a
sprite-<em>loca</em>l block. Sprite-local variables are similarly marked.</p>

<p>But you don’t define greet as friend or greet as enemy in Dog. Each kind
of dog has a different behavior. Here’s what a CockerSpaniel does:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image764.png" alt="" />{width=”4.052777777777778in”
height=”0.7430555555555556in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image764.png" alt="" />{width=”4.074305555555555in”
height=”0.7013888888888888in”}And here’s what a PitBull does:</p>

<p>Greet is defined in the Dog sprite. If Fido is a particular cocker
spaniel, and you ask Fido to greet someone, Fido inherits the greet
method from Dog, but Dog itself couldn’t actually run that method,
because Dog doesn’t have greet as friend or greet as enemy. And perhaps
only individual dogs such as Fido have friend? methods. Even though the
greet method is defined in the Dog sprite, when it’s running it
remembers what specific dog sprite called it, so it knows which greet as
friend to use. Dog’s greet block is called a <em>polymorphic</em> method,
because it means different things to different dogs, even though they
all share the same script.</p>

<h2 id="local-state-in-sprites-variables-and-attributes">Local State in Sprites: Variables and Attributes</h2>

<p>A sprite’s memory of its own past history takes two main forms. It has
<em>variables,</em> created explicitly by the user with the “Make a variable”
button; it also has <em>attributes,</em> the qualities every sprite has
automatically, such as position, direction, and pen color. Each variable
can be examined using its own orange oval block; there is one set block
to modify all variables. Attributes, however, have a less uniform
programming interface in Scratch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A sprite’s <em>direction</em> can be examined with the direction block, and
modified with the point in direction block. It can also be modified
less directly using the blocks turn, point towards, and if on edge,
bounce.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way for a script to examine a sprite’s <em>pen color,</em> but
there are blocks set pen color to &lt;color&gt;, set pen color to
&lt;number&gt;, and change pen color to modify it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sprite’s <em>name</em> can be neither examined nor modified by scripts;
it can be modified by typing a new name directly into the box that
displays the name, above the scripting area.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The block, if any, that examines a variable or attribute is called its
<em>getter;</em> a block (there may be more than one, as in the direction
example above) that modifies a variable or attribute is called a
<em>setter.</em></p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image770.png" alt="" />{width=”2.2381944444444444in”
height=”2.084722222222222in”}In Snap<em>!</em> we allow virtually all
attributes to be examined. But instead of adding dozens of reporters, we
use a more uniform interface for attributes: The my block’s menu (in
Sensing; see page 78) includes many of the attributes of a sprite. It
serves as a general getter for those attributes, e.g., my [anchor] to
find the sprite, if any, to which this sprite is attached in a nesting
arrangement (see page 10). Similarly, the same set block used to set
variable values allows setting some sprite attributes.</p>

<h2 id="prototyping-parents-and-children">Prototyping: Parents and Children</h2>

<p>Most current OOP languages use a <em>class/instance</em> approach to creating
objects. A class is a particular <em>kind of object,</em> and an instance is an
<em>actual object</em> of that type. For example, there might be a Dog class,
and several instances Fido, Spot, and Runt. The class typically
specifies the methods shared by all dogs (RollOver, SitUpAndBeg, Fetch,
and so on), and the instances contain data such as species, color, and
friendliness. Snap<em>!</em> uses a different approach called <em>prototyping,</em> in
which there is no distinction between classes and instances. Prototyping
is better suited to an experimental, tinkering style of work: You make a
single dog sprite, with both methods (blocks) and data (variables); you
can actually watch it and interact with it on the stage; and when you
like it, you use it as the prototype from which to clone other dogs. If
you later discover a bug in the behavior of dogs, you can edit a method
in the parent, and all of the children will automatically share the new
version of the method block. Experienced class/instance programmers may
find prototyping strange at first, but it is actually a more expressive
system, because you can easily simulate a class/instance hierarchy by
hiding the prototype sprite! Prototyping is also a better fit with the
Scratch design principle that everything in a project should be concrete
and visible on the stage; in class/instance OOP the programming process
begins with an abstract, invisible entity, the class, that must be
designed before any concrete objects can be made.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image748.png" alt="" />{width=”7.500694444444444in”
height=”1.5743055555555556in”}There are three ways to make a child
sprite. If you control-click or right-click on a sprite in the “sprite
corral” at the bottom right corner of the window, you get a menu that
includes “clone” as one of the choices. There is an a new clone of block
in the Control palette that creates and reports a child sprite. And
sprites have a “parent” attribute that can be set, like any attribute,
thereby <em>changing</em> the parent of an existing sprite.</p>

<h2 id="inheritance-by-delegation">Inheritance by Delegation</h2>

<p>A clone <em>inherits</em> properties of its parent. “Properties” include
scripts, custom blocks, variables, named lists, system attributes,
costumes, and sounds. Each individual property can be shared between
parent and child, or not shared (with a separate one in the child). The
getter block for a shared property, in the child’s palette, is displayed
in a lighter color; separate properties of the child are displayed in
the traditional colors.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a new clone is created, by default it shares only its methods,
wardrobe, and jukebox with its parent. All other properties are copied
to the clone, but not shared. (One exception is that a new <em>permanent</em>
clone is given a random position. Another is that <em>temporary</em> clones
share the scripts in their parent’s scripting area. A third is that
sprite-local variables that the parent creates <em>after</em> cloning are
shared with its children.) If the value of a shared property is
changed in the parent, then the children see the new value. If the
value of a shared property is changed in the <em>child</em>, then the sharing
link is broken, and a new private version is created in that child.
(This is the mechanism by which a child chooses not to share a
property with its parent.) “Changed” in this context means using the
set or change block for a variable, editing a block in the Block
Editor, editing a costume or sound, or inserting, deleting, or
reordering costumes or sounds. To change a property from unshared to
shared, the child uses the inherit command block. The pulldown menu in
the block lists all the things this sprite can inherit from its parent
(which might be nothing, if this sprite has no parent) and is not
already inheriting. But that would prevent telling a child to inherit,
so if the inherit block is inside a ring, its pulldown menu includes
all the things a child could inherit from this sprite. Right-clicking
on the scripting area of a permanent clone gives a menu option to
share the entire collection of scripts from its parent, as a temporary
clone does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rules are full of details, but the basic idea is simple: Parents can
change their children, but children can’t directly change their parents.
That’s what you’d expect from the word “inherit”: the influence just
goes in one direction. When a child changes some property, it’s
declaring independence from its parent (with respect to that one
property). What if you really want the child to be able to make a change
in the parent (and therefore in itself and all its siblings)? Remember
that in this system any object can tell any other object to do
something:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image779.png" alt="" />{width=”5.072916666666667in”
height=”0.5833333333333334in”}When a sprite gets a message for which it
doesn’t have a corresponding block, the message is <em>delegated</em> to that
sprite’s parent. When a sprite does have the corresponding block, then
the message is not delegated. If the script that implements a delegated
message refers to my (self), it means the child to which the message was
originally sent, not the parent to which the message was delegated.</p>

<h2 id="first-class-costumes-and-sounds">First Class Costumes and Sounds</h2>

<p>Costumes and sounds don’t have methods, as sprites do; you can’t ask
them to do things. But they <em>are</em> first class: you can make a list of
them, put them in variables, use them as input to a procedure, and so
on. My [costumes] and my [sounds] report lists of them.</p>

<h3 id="media-computation-with-costumes">Media Computation with Costumes</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image783.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6319444444444444in”
height=”0.1875in”}The components of a costume are its name, width,
height, and pixels. The block gives access to these components using its
left menu. From its right menu you can choose the current costume, the
Turtle costume, or any costume in the sprite’s wardrobe. Since costumes
are first class, you can also drop an expression whose value is a
costume, or a list of costumes, on that second input slot. (Due to a
misfeature, even though you can select Turtle in the right menu, the
block reports 0 for its width and height, and an empty string for the
other components.) The costume’s width and height are in its standard
orientation, regardless of the sprite’s current direction. (This is
different from the <em>sprite’s</em> width and height, reported by the my
block.)</p>

<p>But the really interesting part of a costume is its bitmap, a list of
<em>pixels</em>. (A pixel, short for “picture element,” represents one dot on
your display.) Each pixel is itself a list of four items, the red,
green, and blue components of its color (in the range 0-255) and what is
standardly called its “transparency” but should be called its opacity,
also in the range 0-255, in which 0 means that the pixel is invisible
and 255 means that it’s fully opaque: you can’t see anything from a
rearward layer at that point on the stage. (Costume pixels typically
have an opacity of 0 only for points inside the bounding box of the
costume but not actually part of the costume; points in the interior of
a costume typically have an opacity of 255. Intermediate values appear
mainly at the edge of a costume, or at sharp boundaries between colors
inside the costume, where they are used to reduce “jaggies”: the
stairstep-like shape of a diagonal line displayed on an array of
discrete rectangular screen coordinates. Note that the opacity of a
<em>sprite</em> pixel is determined by combining the costume’s opacity with the
sprite’s ghost effect. (The latter really is a measure of transparency:
0 means opaque and 100 means invisible.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image784.png" alt="" />{width=”6.100694444444445in”
height=”1.3895833333333334in”}The bitmap is a one-dimensional list of
pixels, not an array of <em>height</em> rows of <em>width</em> pixels each. That’s why
the pixel list has to be combined with the dimensions to produce a
costume. This choice partly reflects the way bitmaps are stored in the
computer’s hardware and operating system, but also makes it easy to
produce transformations of a costume with map:</p>

<p>In this simplest possible transformation, the red value of all the
pixels have been changed to a constant 150. Colors that were red in the
original (such as the logo printed on the t-shirt) become closer to
black (the other color components being near zero); the blue jeans
become purple (blue plus red); perhaps counterintuitively, the white
t-shirt, which has the maximum value for all three color components,
loses some of its red and becomes cyan, the color opposite red on the
color wheel. In reading the code, note that the function that is the
first input to map is applied to a single pixel, whose first item is its
red component. Also note that this process works only on bitmap
costumes; if you call pixels of on a vector costume (one with “svg” in
the corner of its picture), it will be converted to pixels first.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image790.png" alt="" />{width=”2.2569444444444446in”
height=”0.2847222222222222in”}One important point to see here is that a
bitmap (list of pixels) is not, by itself, a costume. The new costume
block creates a costume by combining a bitmap, a width, and a height.
But, as in the example above, switch to costume will accept a bitmap as
input and will automatically use the width and height of the current
costume. Note that there’s no name input; costumes computed in this way
are all named costume. Note also that the use of switch to costume does
<em>not</em> add the computed costume to the sprite’s wardrobe; to do that, say</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image791.png" alt="" />{width=”7.508333333333334in”
height=”1.2090277777777778in”}Here’s a more interesting example of color
manipulation:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image797.png" alt="" />{width=”4.5625in”
height=”0.40694444444444444in”}Each color value is constrained to be 0,
80, 160, or 240. This gives the picture a more cartoonish look.
Alternatively, you can do the computation taking advantage of
hyperblocks:</p>

<p>Here’s one way to exchange red and green values:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image798.png" alt="" />{width=”7.5in”
height=”0.6555555555555556in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image804.png" alt="" />{width=”0.9583333333333334in”
height=”0.18055555555555555in”}It’s the list that determines the
rearrangement of colors: green➔red, red➔green, and the other two
unchanged. That list is inside another list because otherwise it would
be selecting <em>rows</em> of the pixel array, and we want to select columns.
We use pixels of costume current rather than costume apple because the
latter is always a red apple, so this little program would get stuck
turning it green, instead of alternating colors.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image805.png" alt="" />{width=”5.569444444444445in”

height=”0.22916666666666666in”}The stretch block takes a costume as its
first input, either by selecting a costume from the menu or by dropping
a costume-valued expression such as onto it. The other two inputs are
percents of the original width and height, as advertised, so you can
make fun house mirror versions of costumes:</p>

<p>The resulting costumes can be used with switch to costume and so on.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image305.png" alt="" />{width=”5.330729440069991in”

computer’s camera in your projects using these blocks:</p>

height=”0.24305555555555555in”}Using the video on block turns on the
camera and displays what it sees on the stage, regardless of the inputs
given. The camera remains on until you click the red stop button, your
program runs the stop all block, or you turn it off explicitly with the
block. The video image on the stage is partly ghosted, to an extent
determined by the set video transparency block, whose input really is

visible.) By default, the video image is mirrored, like the selfie
camera on your cell phone: When you raise your left hand, your image
raises its right hand. You can control this

height=”1.6125in”}The video snap on block then takes a still picture
from the camera, and trims it to fit on the selected sprite. (Video snap
on stage means to use the entire stage-sized rectangle.) For example,
here’s a camera snapshot trimmed to fit Alonzo:</p>

height=”1.2986111111111112in”}The “Video Capture” project in the
Examples collection repeatedly takes such trimmed snapshots and has the
Alonzo sprite use the current snapshot as its costume, so it looks like
this:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image817.png" alt="" />{width=”2.6666666666666665in”

height=”2.5in”}(The picture above was actually taken with transparency
set to 50, to make the background more visible for printing.) Because
the sprite is always still in the place where the snapshot was taken,
its costume exactly fits in with the rest of the full-stage video. If
you were to add a move 100 steps block after the switch to costume,
you’d see something like this:</p>

<p>This time, the sprite’s costume was captured at one position, and then
the sprite is shown at a different position. (You probably wouldn’t want
to do this, but perhaps it’s helpful for explanatory purposes.)</p>

it’s his project. But he’s vacationing. ☺) Video motion compares two
snapshots a moment apart, looking only at the part within the given trim
(here myself, meaning the current sprite, not the person looking into
the camera), to detect a difference between them. It reports a number,
measuring the number of pixels through which some part of the picture
has moved. Video direction also compares two snapshots to detect motion,
but what it reports is the direction (in the point in direction sense)
of the motion. So the script above moves the sprite in the direction in
which it’s being pushed, but only if a significant amount of motion is
found; otherwise the sprite would jiggle around too much. And yes, you
can run the second script without the first to push a balloon around the
stage.</p>

<h3 id="media-computation-with-sounds-media-computation-with-sounds-listparagraph">Media Computation with Sounds {#media-computation-with-sounds .ListParagraph}</h3>

<p>The starting point for computation with sound is the microphone block.
It starts by recording a brief burst of sound from your microphone. (How
brief? On my computer, 0.010667 seconds, but you’ll see shortly how to
ﬁnd out or control the sample size on your computer.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image826.png" alt="" />{width=”1.9652777777777777in”
height=”0.2569444444444444in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image827.png" alt="" />{width=”5.999305555555556in”
height=”2.620138888888889in”}Just as the <em>pixel</em> is the smallest piece
of a picture, the <em>sample</em> is the smallest piece of a sound. It says
here: that on my computer, 48,000 samples are recorded per second, so
each sample is 1/48,000 of a second. The value of a sample is between -1
and 1, and represents the sound pressure on the microphone—how hard
the air is pushing—at that instant. (You can skip the next page or so
if you know about Fourier analysis.) Here’s a picture of 400 samples:</p>

<p>In this graph, the <em>x</em> axis represents the time at which each sample was
measured; the <em>y</em> axis measures the value of the sample at that time.
The first obvious thing about this graph is that it has a lot of ups and
downs. The most basic up-and-down function is the <em>sine wave:</em></p>

<p>Every periodic function (more or less, any sample that sounds like music
rather than sounding like static) is composed of a sum of sine waves of
different frequencies.</p>

<p>Look back at the graph of our sampled sound. There is a green dot every
seven samples. There’s nothing magic about the number seven; I tried
different values until I found one that looked right. What “right” means
is that, for the first few dots at least, they coincide almost perfectly
with the high points and low points of the graph. Near the middle
(horizontally) of the graph, the green dots don’t seem anywhere near the
high and low points, but if you find the very lowest point of the graph,
about 2/3 of the way along, the dots start lining up almost perfectly
again.</p>

<p>The red graph above shows two <em>cycles</em> of a sine wave. One cycle goes
up, then down, then up again. The amount of time taken for one cycle is
the <em>period</em> of the sine function. If the green dots match both ups and
downs in the captured sound, then two dots—14 samples, or 14/48000 of
a second—represent the period. The first cycle and a half of the graph
looks like it could be a pure sine wave, but after that, the tops and
bottoms don’t line up, and there are peculiar little jiggles, such as
the one before the fifth green dot. This happens because sine waves of
different periods are added together.</p>

<p>It turns out to be more useful to measure the reciprocal of the period,
in our case, 48000/14 or about 3429 <em>cycles per second.</em> Another name
for “cycles per second” is “Hertz,” abbreviated Hz, so our sound has a
component at 3249 Hz. As a musical note, that’s about an A (a little
flat), four octaves above middle C. (Don’t worry too much about the note
being a little off; remember that the 14-sample period was just
eyeballed and is unlikely to be exactly right.)</p>

<p>Four octaves above middle C is really high! That would be a
shrill-sounding note. But remember that a complex waveform is the sum of
multiple sine waves at different frequency. Here’s a different
up-and-down regularity:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image828.png" alt="" />{width=”2.795138888888889in”
height=”1.2222222222222223in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image829.png" alt="" />{width=”2.7847222222222223in”
height=”1.0486111111111112in”}It’s not obvious, but in the left part of
the graph, the signal is more above the <em>x</em> axis than below it. Toward
the right, it seems to be more below than above the axis. At the very
right it looks like it might be climbing again.</p>

<p>The period of the red sine wave is 340 samples, or 340/48000 second.
That’s a frequency of about 141 Hz, about D below middle C. Again, this
is measuring by eyeball, but likely to be close to the right frequency.</p>

<p>All this eyeballing doesn’t seem very scientific. Can’t we just get the
computer to find all the relevant frequencies? Yes, we can, using a
mathematical technique called <em>Fourier analysis.</em> (Jean-Baptiste Joseph
Fourier, 1768–1830, made many contributions to mathematics and physics,
but is best known for working out the nature of periodic functions as a
sum of sine waves.) Luckily we don’t have to do the math; the microphone
block will do it for us, if we ask for microphone spectrum:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image830.png" alt="" />{width=”7.493055555555555in”
height=”1.4861111111111112in”}These are frequency spectra from (samples
of) three different songs. The most obvious thing about these graphs is
that their overall slope is downward; the loudest frequency is the
lowest frequency. That’s typical of music.</p>

<p>The next thing to notice is that there’s a regularity in the spacing of
spikes in the graph. This is partly just an artifact; the frequency
(horizontal) axis isn’t continuous. There are a finite number of
“buckets” (default: 512), and all the frequencies within a bucket
contribute to the amplitude (vertical axis) of that bucket. The spectrum
is a list of that many amplitudes. But the patterns of alternating
rising and falling values are real; the frequencies that are multiples
of the main note being sampled will have higher amplitude than other
frequencies.</p>

<p>Samples and spectrum are the two most detailed representations of a
sound. But the microphone block has other, simpler options also:</p>

<p>volume the instantaneous volume when the block is called</p>

<p>note the MIDI note number (as in play note) of the main note heard</p>

<p>frequency the frequency in Hz of the main note heard</p>

<p>sample rate the number of samples being collected per second</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image258.png" alt="" />{width=”2.9166666666666665in”
height=”0.28125in”}resolution the size of the array in which data are
collected (typically 512, must be a power of 2)</p>

<p>The block for sounds that corresponds to new picture for pictures is</p>

<p>Its first input is a list of samples, and its second input specifies how
many samples occupy one second.</p>

<h1 id="oop-with-procedures">OOP with Procedures</h1>

<p>The idea of object oriented programming is often taught in a way that
makes it seem as if a special object oriented programming language is
necessary. In fact, any language with ﬁrst class procedures and lexical
scope allows objects to be implemented explicitly; this is a useful
exercise to help demystify objects.</p>

<p>The central idea of this implementation is that an object is represented
as a <em>dispatch procedure</em> that takes a message as input and reports the
corresponding method. In this section we start with a stripped-down
example to show how local state works, and build up to full
implementations of class/instance and prototyping OOP.</p>

<h2 id="local-state-with-script-variables">Local State with Script Variables</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image836.png" alt="" />{width=”3.473611111111111in”
height=”3.1805555555555554in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image852.png" alt="" />{width=”2.2395833333333335in”
height=”1.5104166666666667in”}This script implements an object <em>class</em>,
a type of object, namely the counter class. In this ﬁrst simplified
version there is only one method, so no explicit message passing is
necessary. When the make a counter block is called, it reports a
procedure, the ringed script inside its body. That procedure implements
a specific counter object, an <em>instance</em> of the counter class. When
invoked, a counter instance increases and reports its count variable.
Each counter has its own local count:</p>

<p>This example will repay careful study, because it isn’t obvious why each
instance has a separate count. From the point of view of the make a
counter procedure, each invocation causes a new count variable to be
created. Usually such <em>script variables</em> are temporary, going out of
existence when the script ends. But this one is special, because make a
counter returns <em>another script</em> that makes reference to the count
variable, so it remains active. (The script variables block makes
variables local to a script. It can be used in a sprite’s script area or
in the Block Editor. Script variables can be “exported” by being used in
a reported procedure, as here.)</p>

<p>In this approach to OOP, we are representing both classes and instances
as procedures. The make a counter block represents the class, while each
instance is represented by a nameless script created each time make a
counter is called. The script variables created inside the make a
counter block but outside the ring are <em>instance variables,</em> belonging
to a particular counter.</p>

<h2 id="messages-and-dispatch-procedures">Messages and Dispatch Procedures</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image853.png" alt="" />{width=”4.416666666666667in”
height=”3.1666666666666665in”}In the simplified class above, there is
only one method, and so there are no messages; you just call the
instance to carry out its one method. Here is a more refined version
that uses message passing:</p>

<p>Again, the make a counter block represents the counter class, and again
the script creates a local variable count each time it is invoked. The
large outer ring represents an instance. It is a <em>dispatch procedure:</em>
it takes a message (just a text word) as input, and it reports a method.
The two smaller rings are the methods. The top one is the next method;
the bottom one is the reset method. The latter requires an input, named
value.</p>

<p>In the earlier version, calling the instance did the entire job. In this
version, calling the instance gives access to a method, which must then
be called to finish the job. We can provide a block to do both procedure
calls in one:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image854.png" alt="" />{width=”4.010416666666667in”
height=”0.7077198162729659in”}</p>

<p>The ask block has two required inputs: an object and a message. It also
accepts optional additional inputs, which Snap<em>!</em> puts in a list; that
list is named args inside the block. Ask has two nested call blocks. The
inner one calls the object, i.e., the dispatch procedure. The dispatch
procedure always takes exactly one input, namely the message. It reports
a method, which may take any number of inputs; note that this is the
situation in which we drop a list of values onto the arrowheads of a
multiple input (in the outer call block). Note also that this is one of
the rare cases in which we must unringify the inner call block, whose
<em>value when called</em> gives the method.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image837.png" alt="" />{width=”3.9069444444444446in”
height=”1.6125in”}</p>

<h2 id="inheritance-via-delegation">Inheritance via Delegation</h2>

<p>So, our objects now have local state variables and message passing. What
about inheritance? We can provide that capability using the technique of
<em>delegation</em>. Each instance of the child class contains an instance of
the parent class, and simply passes on the messages it doesn’t want to
specialize:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image857.png" alt="" />{width=”3.8125in”
height=”3.5833333333333335in”}</p>

<p>This script implements the buzzer class, which is a child of counter.
Instead of having a count (a number) as a local state variable, each
buzzer has a counter (an object) as a local state variable. The class
specializes the next method, reporting what the counter reports unless
that result is divisible by 7, in which case it reports “buzz.” (Yeah,
it should also check for a digit 7 in the number, but this code is
complicated enough already.) If the message is anything other than next,
though, such as reset, then the buzzer simply invokes its counter’s
dispatch procedure. So the counter handles any message that the buzzer
doesn’t handle explicitly. (Note that in the non-next case we call the
counter, not ask it something, because we want to report a method, not
the value that the message reports.) So, if we ask a buzzer to reset to
a value divisible by 7, it will end up reporting that number, not
“buzz.”</p>

<h2 id="an-implementation-of-prototyping-oop">An Implementation of Prototyping OOP</h2>

<p>In the class/instance system above, it is necessary to design the
complete behavior of a class before you can make any instances of the
class. This is okay for top-down design, but not great for
experimentation. Here we sketch the implementation of a <em>prototyping</em>
OOP system: You make an object, tinker with it, make clones of it, and
keep tinkering. Any changes you make in the parent are inherited by its
children. In effect, that first object is both the class and an instance
of the class. In the implementation below, children share properties
(methods and local variables) of their parent unless and until a child
changes a property, at which point that child gets a private copy. (If a
child wants to change something for its entire family, it must ask the
parent to do it.)</p>

<p>Because we want to be able to create and delete properties dynamically,
we won’t use Snap<em>!</em> variables to hold an object’s variables or methods.
Instead, each object has two <em>tables,</em> called methods and data, each of
which is an <em>association list:</em> a list of two-item lists, in which each
of the latter contains a <em>key</em> and a corresponding <em>value.</em> We provide a
lookup procedure to locate the key-value pair corresponding to a given
key in a given table.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image858.png" alt="" />{width=”3.2152777777777777in”

height=”1.15625in”}</p>

<p>There are also commands to insert and delete entries:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image862.png" alt="" />{width=”3.71875in”
height=”1.8263888888888888in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image863.png" alt="" />{width=”3.2291666666666665in”
height=”2.1283136482939633in”}</p>

<p>As in the class/instance version, an object is represented as a dispatch
procedure that takes a message as its input and reports the
corresponding method. When an object gets a message, it will ﬁrst look
for that keyword in its methods table. If it’s found, the corresponding
value is the method we want. If not, the object looks in its data table.
If a value is found there, what the object returns is <em>not</em> that value,
but rather a reporter method that, when called, will report the value.
This means that what an object returns is <em>always</em> a method.</p>

<p>If the object has neither a method nor a datum with the desired name,
but it does have a parent, then the parent (that is, the parent’s
dispatch procedure) is invoked with the message as its input.
Eventually, either a match is found, or an object with no parent is
found; the latter case is an error, meaning that the user has sent the
object a message not in its repertoire.</p>

<p>Messages can take any number of inputs, as in the class/instance system,
but in the prototyping version, every method automatically gets the
object to which the message was originally sent as an extra ﬁrst input.
We must do this so that if a method is found in the parent (or
grandparent, etc.) of the original recipient, and that method refers to
a variable or method, it will use the child’s variable or method if the
child has its own version.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image864.png" alt="" />{width=”4.375in”
height=”7.469444444444444in”}The clone of block below takes an object as
its input and makes a child object. It should be considered as an
internal part of the implementation; the preferred way to make a child
of an object is to send that object a clone message.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image865.png" alt="" />{width=”1.5729166666666667in”
height=”0.6875in”}Every object is created with predefined methods for
set, method, delete-var, delete-method, and clone. It has one predefined
variable, parent. Objects without a parent are created by calling new
object:</p>

<p>As before, we provide procedures to call an object’s dispatch procedure
and then call the method. But in this version, we provide the desired
object as the ﬁrst method input. We provide one procedure for Command
methods and one for Reporter methods:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image866.png" alt="" />{width=”6.938888888888889in”
height=”1.0in”}(Remember that the “Input list:” variant of the run and
call blocks is made by dragging the input expression over the arrowheads
rather than over the input slot.)</p>

<p>The script below demonstrates how this prototyping system can be used to
make counters. We start with one prototype counter, called counter1. We
count this counter up a few times, then create a child counter2 and give
it its own count variable, but <em>not</em> its own total variable. The next
method always sets counter1’s total variable, which therefore keeps
count of the total number of times that <em>any</em> counter is incremented.
Running this script should [say] and (think) the following lists:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image870.png" alt="" />{width=”4.208333333333333in”

<h1 id="the-outside-world">The Outside World</h1>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image148.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6201388888888888in”
height=”0.25in”}The facilities discussed so far are fine for projects
that take place entirely on your computer’s screen. But you may want to
write programs that interact with physical devices (sensors or robots)
or with the World Wide Web. For these purposes Snap<em>!</em> provides a single
primitive block:</p>

<p>This might not seem like enough, but in fact it can be used to build the
desired capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="the-world-wide-web">The World Wide Web</h2>

<p>The input to the url block is the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of a
web page. The block reports the body of the Web server’s response (minus
HTTP header), <em>without interpretation.</em> This means that in most cases
the response is a description of the page in HTML (HyperText Markup
Language) notation. Often, especially for commercial web sites, the
actual information you’re trying to find on the page is actually at
another URL included in the reported HTML. The Web page is typically a
very long text string, and so the primitive split block is useful to get
the text in a manageable form, namely, as a list of lines:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image871.png" alt="" />{width=”6.520833333333333in”
height=”4.277777777777778in”}</p>

<p>The second input to split is the character to be used to separate the
text string into a list of lines, or one of a set of common cases (such
as line, which separates on carriage return and/or newline characters.</p>

<p>This might be a good place for a reminder that list-view watchers scroll
through only 100 items at a time. The downarrow near the bottom right
corner of the speech balloon in the picture presents a menu of
hundred-item ranges. (This may seem unnecessary, since the scroll bar
should allow for any number of items, but doing it this way makes
Snap<em>!</em> much faster.) In table view, the entire list is included.</p>

<p>If you include a protocol name in the input to the url block (such as
http:// or https://), that protocol will be used. If not, the block
first tries HTTPS and then, if that fails, HTTP.</p>

<p>A security restriction in JavaScript limits the ability of one web site
to initiate communication with another site. There is an official
workaround for this limitation called the CORS protocol (Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing), but the target site has to allow snap.berkeley.edu
explicitly, and of course most don’t. To get around this problem, you
can use third-party sites (“cors proxies”) that are not limited by
JavaScript and that forward your requests.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-devices">Hardware Devices</h2>

<p>Another JavaScript security restriction prevents Snap<em>!</em> from having
direct access to devices connected to your computer, such as sensors and
robots. (Mobile devices such as smartphones may also have useful devices
built in, such as accelerometers and GPS receivers.) The url block is
also used to interface Snap<em>!</em> with these external capabilities.</p>

<p>The idea is that you run a separate program that both interfaces with
the device and provides a local HTTP server that Snap<em>!</em> can use to make
requests to the device. <em>Unlike</em> Snap<em>!</em> <em>itself, these programs have
access to anything on your computer, so you have to trust the author of
the software!</em> Our web site, snap.berkeley.edu, provides links to
drivers for several devices, including, at this writing, the Lego NXT,
Finch, Hummingbird, and Parallax S2 robots; the Nintendo Wiimote and
Leap Motion sensors, the Arduino microcomputer, and Super-Awesome
Sylvia’s Water Color Bot. The same server technique can be used for
access to third party software libraries, such as the speech synthesis
package linked on our web site.</p>

<p>Most of these packages require some expertise to install; the links are
to source code repositories. This situation will improve with time.</p>

<h2 id="date-and-time">Date and Time</h2>

can be used to find out the current date or time. Each call to this

combine several calls, like this:</p>

<h1 id="continuations">Continuations</h1>

<p>Blocks are usually used within a script. The <em>continuation</em> of a block
within a particular script is the part of the computation that remains
to be completed after the block does its job. A continuation can be
represented as a ringed script. Continuations are always part of the
interpretation of any program in any language, but usually these
continuations are implicit in the data structures of the language
interpreter or compiler. Making continuations explicit is an advanced
but versatile programming technique that allows users to create control
structures such as nonlocal exit and multithreading.</p>

height=”0.8020833333333334in”}But some situations are more complicated.
For example, what is the continuation of move 100 steps in the following
script?</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image877.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6666666666666667in”
height=”1.0729166666666667in”}That’s a trick question; the move block is
run four times, and it has a different continuation each time. The first
time, its continuation is</p>

<p>Note that there is no repeat 3 block in the actual script, but the
continuation has to represent the fact that there are three more times
through the loop to go. The fourth time, the continuation is just</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image878.png" alt="" />{width=”1.59375in”
height=”0.29791666666666666in”}What counts is not what’s physically
below the block in the script, but what computational work remains to be
done.</p>

<p>(This is a situation in which visible code may be a little misleading.
We have to put a repeat 3 block in the <em>picture</em> of the continuation,
but the actual continuation is made from the evaluator’s internal
bookkeeping of where it’s up to in a script. So it’s really the original
script plus some extra information. But the pictures here do correctly
represent what work the process still has left to do.)<br />
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image879.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4791666666666667in”
height=”1.25in”}When a block is used inside a custom block, its
continuation may include parts of more than one script. For example, if
we make a custom square block</p>

<p>and then use that block in a script:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image880.png" alt="" />{width=”0.7291666666666666in”
height=”0.59375in”}then the continuation of the first use of move 100
steps is</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image881.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6666666666666667in”
height=”1.2604166666666667in”}in which part comes from inside the square
block and part comes from the call to square. Nevertheless, ordinarily
when we <em>display</em> a continuation we show only the part within the
current script.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image882.png" alt="" />{width=”2.1875in”
height=”0.5729166666666666in”}The continuation of a command block, as
we’ve seen, is a simple script with no input slots. But the continuation
of a <em>reporter</em> block has to do something with the value reported by the
block, so it takes that value as input. For example, in the script</p>

<p>the continuation of the 3+4 block is</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image883.png" alt="" />{width=”3.5729166666666665in”
height=”0.5729166666666666in”}Of course the name result in that picture
is arbitrary; any name could be used, or no name at all by using the
empty-slot notation for input substitution.</p>

<h2 id="continuation-passing-style">Continuation Passing Style</h2>

<p>Like all programming languages, Snap<em>!</em> evaluates compositions of nested
reporters from the inside out. For example, in the expression
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image884.png" alt="" />{width=”1.3125in”
height=”0.22916666666666666in”}Snap<em>!</em> first adds 4 and 5, then
multiplies 3 by that sum. This often means that the order in which the
operations are done is backwards from the order in which they appear in
the expression: When reading the above expression you say “times” before
you say “plus.” In English, instead of saying “three times four plus
five,” which actually makes the order of operations ambiguous, you could
say, “take the sum of four and five, and then take the product of three
and that sum.” This sounds more awkward, but it has the virtue of
putting the operations in the order in which they’re actually performed.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image885.png" alt="" />{width=”3.1875in”
height=”0.3541666666666667in”}That may seem like overkill in a simple
expression, but suppose you’re trying to convey the expression</p>

<p>to a friend over the phone. If you say “factorial of three times
factorial of two plus two plus five” you might mean any of these:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image886.png" alt="" />{width=”3.1875in”
height=”1.71875in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image894.png" alt="" />{width=”7.490277777777778in”
height=”3.622916666666667in”}Wouldn’t it be better to say, “Add two and
two, take the factorial of that, add five to that, multiply three by
that, and take the factorial of the result”? We can do a similar
reordering of an expression if we first define versions of all the
reporters that take their continuation as an explicit input. In the
following picture, notice that the new blocks are <em>commands</em>, not
reporters.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image904.png" alt="" />{width=”4.052777777777778in”
height=”1.6354166666666667in”}We can check that these blocks give the
results we want:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image908.png" alt="" />{width=”5.533333333333333in”
height=”2.3180555555555555in”}The original expression can now be
represented as</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image909.png" alt="" />{width=”2.1930555555555555in”
height=”1.0527777777777778in”}If you read this top to bottom, don’t you
get “Add two and two, take the factorial of that, add five to that,
multiply three by that, and take the factorial of the result”? Just what
we wanted! This way of working, in which every block is a command that
takes a continuation as one of its inputs, is called
<em>continuation-passing style (CPS).</em> Okay, it looks horrible, but it has
subtle virtues. One of them is that each script is just one block long
(with the rest of the work buried in the continuation given to that one
block), so each block doesn’t have to remember what else to do—in the
vocabulary of this section, the (implicit) continuation of each block is
empty. Instead of the usual picture of recursion, with a bunch of little
people all waiting for each other, with CPS what happens is that each
little person hands off the problem to the next one and goes to the
beach, so there’s only one active little person at a time. In this
example, we start with Alfred, an add specialist, who computes the value
4 and then hands off the rest of the problem to Francine, a factorial
specialist. She computes the value 24, then hands the problem off to
Anne, another add specialist, who computes 29. And so on, until finally
Sam, a say specialist, says the value 2.107757298379527×10^132^, which
is a very large number!</p>

<p>Go back to the definitions of these blocks. The ones, such as add, that
correspond to primitive reporters are simple; they just call the
reporter and then call their continuation with its result. But the
definition of factorial is more interesting. It doesn’t just call our
original factorial reporter and send the result to its continuation. CPS
is used inside factorial too! It says, “See if my input is zero. Send
the (true or false) result to if. If the result is true, then call my
continuation with the value 1. Otherwise, subtract 1 from my input. Send
the result of that to factorial, with a continuation that multiplies the
smaller number’s factorial by my original input. Finally, call my
continuation with the product.” You can use CPS to unwind even the most
complicated branched recursions.</p>

<p>By the way, I cheated a bit above. The if/else block should also use
CPS; it should take one true/false input and <em>two continuations.</em> It
will go to one or the other continuation depending on the value of its
input. But in fact the C-shaped blocks (or E-shaped, like if/else) are
really using CPS in the first place, because they implicitly wrap rings
around the sub-scripts within their branches. See if you can make an
explicitly CPS if/else block.</p>

<h2 id="callrun-wcontinuation">Call/Run w/Continuation</h2>

<p>To use explicit continuation passing style, we had to define special
versions of all the reporters, add and so on. Snap<em>!</em> provides a
primitive mechanism for capturing continuations when we need to, without
using continuation passing throughout a project.</p>

<p>Here’s the classic example. We want to write a recursive block that
takes a list of numbers as input, and reports the product of all the
numbers:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image910.png" alt="" />{width=”3.8958333333333335in”
height=”1.9375in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image911.png" alt="" />{width=”3.8958333333333335in”
height=”1.3416666666666666in”}But we can improve the efficiency of this
block, in the case of a list that includes a zero; as soon as we see the
zero, we know that the entire product is zero.</p>

<p>But this is not as efficient as it might seem. Consider, as an example,
the list 1,2,3,0,4,5. We find the zero on the third recursive call (the
fourth call altogether), as the first item of the sublist 0,4,5. What is
the continuation of the report 0 block? It’s</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image912.png" alt="" />{width=”4.333333333333333in”
height=”0.4166666666666667in”}Even though we already know that result is
zero, we’re going to do three unnecessary multiplications while
unwinding the recursive calls.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image913.png" alt="" />{width=”4.038194444444445in”
height=”1.9256944444444444in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image914.png" alt="" />{width=”3.9451388888888888in”
height=”1.0979166666666667in”}We can improve upon this by capturing the
continuation of the top-level call to product:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image915.png" alt="" />{width=”2.7083333333333335in”
height=”0.2916666666666667in”}The
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image916.png" alt="" />{width=”1.59125in”
height=”0.18611111111111112in”} block takes as its input a one-input
script, as shown in the product example. It calls that script with <em>the
continuation of the</em> call-with-continuation <em>block itself</em> as its input.
In this case, that continuation is</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image917.png" alt="" />{width=”4.40625in”
height=”1.15625in”}reporting to whichever script called product. If the
input list doesn’t include a zero, then nothing is ever done with that
continuation, and this version works just like the original product. But
if the input list is 1,2,3,0,4,5, then three recursive calls are made,
the zero is seen, and product-helper <em>runs the continuation,</em> with an
input of 0. The continuation immediately reports that 0 to the caller of
product, <em>without</em> unwinding all the recursive calls and without the
unnecessary multiplications.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image918.png" alt="" />{width=”4.385416666666667in”
height=”0.5104166666666666in”}I could have written product a little more
simply using a Reporter ring instead of a Command ring:</p>

<p>but it’s customary to use a script to represent the input to
call<strong> </strong>w/continuation because very often that input takes the form</p>

<p>so that the continuation is saved permanently and can be called from
anywhere in the project. That’s why the input slot in call
w/continuation has a Command ring rather than a Reporter ring.</p>

<p>First class continuations are an experimental feature in Snap<em>!</em> and
there are many known limitations in it. One is that the display of
reporter continuations shows only the single block in which the call
w/continuation is an input.</p>

<h3 id="nonlocal-exit">Nonlocal exit</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image919.png" alt="" />{width=”6.268055555555556in”
height=”1.125in”}Many programming languages have a break command that
can be used inside a looping construct such as repeat to end the
repetition early. Using first class continuations, we can generalize
this mechanism to allow nonlocal exit even within a block called from
inside a loop, or through several levels of nested loops:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image923.png" alt="" />{width=”1.8541666666666667in”
height=”2.6534722222222222in”}The upvar break has as its value a
continuation that can be called from anywhere in the program to jump
immediately to whatever comes after the catch block in its script.
Here’s an example with two nested invocations of catch, with the upvar
renamed in the outer one:</p>

<p>As shown, this will say 1, then 2, then 3, then exit both nested catches
and think “Hmm.” If in the run block the variable break is used instead
of outer, then the script will say 1, 2, 3, and “Hello!” before thinking
“Hmm.”</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image924.png" alt="" />{width=”4.354166666666667in”
height=”1.4708333333333334in”}There are corresponding catch and throw
blocks for reporters. The catch block is a reporter that takes an
expression as input instead of a C-shaped slot. But the throw block is a
command; it doesn’t report a value to its own continuation, but instead
reports a value (which it takes as an additional input, in addition to
the catch tag) to <em>the corresponding catch block</em>’s continuation:</p>

<p>Without the throw, the inner call reports 5, the + block reports 8, so
the catch block reports 8, and the × block reports 80. With the throw,
the inner call doesn’t report at all, and neither does the + block. The
throw block’s input of 20 becomes the value reported by the catch block,
and the × block multiplies 10 and 20.<br />
<strong>Creating a Thread System</strong></p>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> can be running several scripts at once, within a single sprite
and across many sprites. If you only have one computer, how can it do
many things at once? The answer is that only one is actually running at
any moment, but Snap<em>!</em> switches its attention from one script to
another frequently. At the bottom of every looping block (repeat, repeat
until, forever), there is an implicit “yield” command, which remembers
where the current script is up to, and switches to some other script,
each in turn. At the end of every script is an implicit “end thread”
command (a <em>thread</em> is the technical term for the process of running a
script), which switches to another script without remembering the old
one.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image928.png" alt="" />{width=”2.9479166666666665in”
height=”4.254166666666666in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image929.png" alt="" />{width=”6.5569444444444445in”
height=”2.770138888888889in”}Since this all happens automatically, there
is generally no need for the user to think about threads. But, just to
show that this, too, is not magic, here is an implementation of a simple
thread system. It uses a global variable named tasks that initially
contains an empty list. Each use of the C-shaped thread block adds a
continuation (the ringed script) to the list. The yield block uses run
w/continuation to create a continuation for a partly done thread, adds
it to the task list, and then runs the first waiting task. The
end<strong> </strong>thread block (which is automatically added at the end of every
thread’s script by the thread block) just runs the next waiting task.</p>

<p>Here is a sample script using the thread system. One thread says
numbers; the other says letters. The number thread yields after every
prime number, while the letter thread yields after every vowel. So the
sequence of speech balloons is
1,2,a,3,b,c,d,e,4,5,f,g,h,i,6,7,j,k,l,m,n,o,8,9,10,11,
p,q,r,s,t,u,12,13,v,w,x,y,z,14,15,16,17,18,…30.</p>

<p>If we wanted this to behave exactly like Snap<em>!</em>’s own threads, we’d
define new versions of repeat and so on that run yield after each
repetition.</p>

<h1 id="metaprogramming">Metaprogramming</h1>

<p>The scripts and custom blocks that make up a program can be examined or

<p>The definition of block takes a custom block (in a ring, since it’s the
block itself that’s the input, not the result of calling the block) as
input and reports the block’s definition, i.e., its inputs and body, in
the form of a ring with named inputs corresponding to the block’s input
names, so that those input names are bound in the body.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image939.png" alt="" />{width=”7.4in”
height=”2.51in”}The split by blocks block takes any expression or script
as input (ringed) and reports a list representing a <em>syntax tree</em> for
the script or expression, in which the first item is a block with no
inputs and the remaining items are the input values, which may
themselves be syntax trees.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image943.png" alt="" />{width=”7.496969597550306in”
height=”2.079861111111111in”}Using split by blocks to select custom
blocks whose definitions contain another block gives us this debugging
aid:</p>

<p>Note in passing the my blocks block, which reports a list of all visible
blocks, primitive and custom. (There’s also a my categories block, which
reports a list of the names of the palette categories.) Also note
custom? of block, which reports True if its input is a custom block.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-block">Writing a block</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image947.png" alt="" />{width=”6.071211723534558in”
height=”2.209722222222222in”}The inverse function to split by blocks is
provided by the join block, which when given a syntax tree as input
reports the corresponding expression or script.</p>

<p>Here we are taking the definition of square, modifying the repetition
count (to 6), modifying the turning angle (to 60), using join to turn
the result back into a ringed definition, and using the define block to
create a new hexagon block.</p>

<p>The define block has three “input” slots. The quotation marks are there
because the first slot is an upvar, i.e., a way for define to provide
information to its caller, rather than the other way around. In this
case, the value of block is the new block itself (the hexagon block, in
this example). The second slot is where you give the <em>label</em> for the new
block. In this example, the label is “hexagon _” in which the
underscore represents an input slot. So, here are a few examples of
block labels:</p>

<p>set pen _ to _</p>

<p>for _ = _ to _ _</p>

<p>ask _ and wait</p>

<p>_ of _</p>

<p>Note that the underscores are separated from the block text by spaces.
Note in the case of the for block’s label that the upvar (the i) and the
C-slot both count as inputs. Note also that the label is not meant to be
a unique symbol that represents only this block. For example,
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image628.png" alt="" />{width=”0.8611111111111112in”
height=”0.19444444444444445in”} and <img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image376.png" alt="A picture containing text, hitting
Description automatically
generated" />{width=”1.15in”
height=”0.19in”} both have the label</p>

<p>_ of _. The label does not give the input slots names (that’s done in
the body, coming next) or types (that’s done in the set _ of block _
to _ block, coming in two paragraphs).</p>

<p>The third slot is for the <em>definition</em> of the new block. This is a
(ringed) script whose input names (formal parameters) will become the
formal parameters of the new block. And the script is its script.</p>

<p>So far we know the block’s label, parameters, and script. There are
other things to specify about the block, and one purpose of the block
upvar is to allow that. In the example on the previous page, there are
four</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image951.png" alt="" />{width=”2.83in”
height=”0.97in”}set _ of block _ to _ blocks, reproduced below for
your convenience:</p>

<p>The category of the block can be set to any primitive or custom
category. The default is other. The type is command, reporter, or
predicate. Command is the default, so this setting is redundant, but we
want to show all the choices in the set block. The scope is either
global or sprite, with global as the default. The last input to set
slots is a list of length less than or equal to the number of
underscores in the label. Each item of the list is a type name, like the
ones in the is (5) a (number)? block. If there is only one input, you
can use just the name instead of putting it in a list. An empty or
missing list item means type Any.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image952.png" alt="" />{width=”4.31in”
height=”0.83in”}It's very important that these set blocks appear in the
same script as the define that creates the block, because the block
upvar is local to that script. You can’t later say, for example,</p>

<p>because the copy of the hexagon block in this instruction counts as
“using” it.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image953.png" alt="" />{width=”2.6in”
height=”0.32in”}The of block reporter is useful to copy attributes from
one block to another, as we copied the definition of square, modified
it, and used it to define hexagon. Some of the values this block reports
are a little unfriendly:</p>

<p>“1”? Yes, this block reports <em>numbers</em> instead of names for category,
type, and scope. The reason is that maybe someday we’ll have
translations to other languages for custom category names, as we already
do for the built-in categories, types, and scopes; if you translate a
program using this block to another language, the numeric outputs won’t
change, simplifying comparisons in your code. The set block accepts
these numbers as an alternative to the names.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image954.png" alt="" />{width=”3.379861111111111in”

for default values instead of types. Now for a block with a menu input:</p>

height=”3.6666666666666665in”}Those replace item blocks aren’t very
elegant. I had to look at foo by hand to figure out where the numbers I
wanted to change are. This situation can be improved with a little
programming:</p>

height=”2.109722222222222in”}Returning to the define block, there’s
another reason for the block upvar: It’s helpful in defining a recursive
procedure using define. For a procedure to call itself, it needs a name
for itself. But in the definition input to the define block, define
itself hasn’t been called yet, so the new block isn’t in the palette
yet. So you do this:</p>

<p>Yes, you put block in the define, but it gets changed into this script
in the resulting definition. You could use this script directly in a
simple case like this, but in a complicated case with a recursive call
inside a ring inside the one giving the block definition, this script

<p>It’s analogous to using explicit formal parameters when you nest calls
to higher order functions.</p>

<h2 id="width576875in-height3879861111111111inmacros"><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image981.png" alt="" />{width=”5.76875in” height=”3.879861111111111in”}Macros</h2>

<p>Users of languages in the C family have learned to think of macros as
entirely about text strings, with no relation to the syntax of the
language. So you can do things like</p>

<p>#define foo baz)</p>

<p>with the result that you can only use the foo macro after an open
parenthesis.</p>

<p>In the Lisp family of languages we have a different tradition, in which
macros are syntactically just like procedure calls, except that the
“procedure” is a macro, with different evaluation rules from ordinary
procedures. Two things make a macro different: its input expressions are
not evaluated, so a macro can establish its own syntax (but still
delimited by parentheses, in Lisp, or still one block, in Snap<em>!</em> ); and
the result of a macro call is a new expression that is evaluated <em>as if
it appeared in the caller</em> of the macro, with access to the caller’s
variables and, implicitly, its continuation.</p>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> has long had the first part of this, the ability to make inputs
unevaluated. In version 8.0 we add the ability to run code in the
context of another procedure, just as we can run code in the context of
another sprite, using the same mechanism: the of block. In the example
on the previous page, the if _ report _ caller block runs a report
block, but not in its own context; it causes <em>the fizzbuzz block</em> to
report “fizz” or “buzz” as appropriate. (Yes, we know that the rules
implemented here are simplified compared to the real game.) It doesn’t
just report out of the entire toplevel script; you can see that map is
able to prepend “The answer is” to each reported value.</p>

<p>This macro capability isn’t fully implemented. First, we shouldn’t have
to use the calling script as an explicit input to the macro. In a later
release, this will be fixed; when defining a block you’ll be able to say
that it’s a macro, and it will automatically get its caller’s context as
an invisible input. Second, there is a possibility of confusion between
the variables of the macro and the variables of its caller. (What if the
macro wanted to refer to a variable value in its caller?) The one
substantial feature of Scheme that we don’t yet implement is <em>hygienic
macros,</em> which make it possible to keep the two namespaces separate.</p>

<h1 id="user-interface-elements">User Interface Elements</h1>

<p>In this chapter we describe in detail the various buttons, menus, and
other clickable elements of the Snap<em>!</em> user interface. Here again is
the map of the Snap<em>!</em> window:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image987.png" alt="" />{width=”7.494419291338582in”
height=”4.663194444444445in”}</p>

<h2 id="tool-bar-features">Tool Bar Features</h2>

<p>Holding down the Shift key while clicking on any of the menu buttons
gives access to an extended menu with options, shown in red, that are
experimental or for use by the developers. We’re not listing those extra
options here because they change frequently and you shouldn’t rely on
them. But they’re not secrets.</p>

<h3 id="the-snap-logo-menu">The Snap<em>!</em> Logo Menu</h3>

<p>The Snap<em>!</em> logo at the left end of the tool bar is clickable. It shows
a menu of options about Snap<em>!</em> itself:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image988.png" alt="" />{width=”2.3292213473315835in”
height=”1.02in”}</p>

<p>The About option displays information about Snap<em>!</em> itself, including
version numbers for the source modules, the implementors, and the
license (AGPL: you can do anything with it except create proprietary
versions, basically).</p>

<p>The Reference manual option downloads a copy of the latest revision of
this manual in PDF format.</p>

<p>The Snap! website option opens a browser window pointing to
snap.berkeley.edu, the web site for Snap<em>!</em>.</p>

<p>The Download source option opens a browser window displaying the Github
repository of the source files for Snap<em>!</em>. At the bottom of the page
are links to download the latest official release. Or you can navigate
around the site to find the current development version. You can read
the code to learn how Snap<em>!</em> is implemented, host a copy on your own
computer (this is one way to keep working while on an airplane), or make
a modified version with customized features. (However, access to cloud
accounts is limited to the official version hosted at Berkeley.)</p>

<h3 id="the-file-menu">The File Menu</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image384.png" alt="" />{width=”0.3194444444444444in”
height=”0.18055555555555555in”}The file icon shows a menu mostly about
saving and loading projects. You may not see all these options, if you
don’t have multiple sprites, scenes, custom blocks, and custom
categories.</p>

<p>The Notes option opens a window in which you can type notes about the
project: How to use it, what it does, whose project you modified to
create it, if any, what other sources of ideas you used, or any other
information about the project. This text is saved with the project, and
is useful if you share it with other users.</p>

<p>The New option starts a new, empty project. Any project you were working
on before disappears, so you are asked to confirm that this is really
what you want. (It disappears only from the current working Snap<em>!</em>
window; you should save the current project, if you want to keep it,
before using New.)</p>

<p>Note the \^N at the end of the line. This indicates that you can type
control-N as a shortcut for this menu item. Alas, this is not the case
in every browser. Some Mac browsers require command-N (⌘N) instead,
while others open a new browser window instead of a new project. You’ll
have to experiment. In general, the keyboard shortcuts in Snap<em>!</em> are
the standard ones you expect in other software.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image989.png" alt="" />{width=”2.8895833333333334in”
height=”2.097916666666667in”}The Open… option shows a project open
dialog box in which you can choose a project to open:</p>

<p>In this dialog, the three large buttons at the left select a source of
projects: Cloud means your Snap<em>!</em> account’s cloud storage. Examples
means a collection of sample projects we provide. Computer is for
projects saved on your own computer; when you click it, this dialog is
replaced with your computer’s system dialog for opening files. The text
box to the right of those buttons is an alphabetical listing of projects
from that source; selecting a project by clicking shows its thumbnail (a
picture of the stage when it was saved) and its project notes at the
right.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image990.png" alt="" />{width=”2.7243055555555555in”
height=”1.9777777777777779in”}The search bar at the top can be used to
find a project by name or text in the project notes. So in this example:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image991.png" alt="" />{width=”2.723611111111111in”
height=”1.9777777777777779in”}I was looking for my ice cream projects
and typed “crea” in the search bar, then wondered why “ferris” matched.
But then when I clicked on ferris I saw this:</p>

<p>My search matched the word “re<em>crea</em>te” in the project notes.</p>

<p>The six buttons at the bottom select an action to perform on the
selected project. In the top row, Recover looks in your cloud account
for older versions of the chosen project. <strong><em>If your project is damaged,
don’t keep saving broken versions! Use Recover first thing.</em></strong> You will
see a list of saved versions; choose one to open it. Typically, you’ll
see the most recent version before the last save, and the newest version
saved before today. Then come buttons Share/Unshare and
Publish/Unpublish. The labelling of the buttons depends on your
project’s publication status. If a project is neither shared nor
published (the ones in lightface type in the project list), it is
private and nobody can see it except you, its owner. If it is shared
(boldface in the project list), then when you open it you’ll see a URL
like this one:</p>

<p>https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=bh&amp;ProjectName=count%20change</p>

<p>but with your username and project name. (“%20” in the project name
represents a space, which can’t be part of a URL.) Anyone who knows this
URL can see your project. Finally, if your project is <strong><em>published</em></strong>
(<strong><em>bold italic</em></strong> in the list), then your project is shown on the
Snap<em>!</em> web site for all the world to see. (In all of these cases, you
are the only one who can <em>write</em> to (save) your project. If another user
saves it, a separate copy will be saved in that user’s account. Projects
remember the history of who created the original version and any other
“remix” versions along the way.</p>

<p>In the second row, the first button, Open, loads the project into
Snap<em>!</em> and closes the dialog box. The next button (if Cloud is the
source) is Delete, and if clicked it deletes the selected project.
Finally, the Cancel button closes the dialog box without opening a
project. (It does not undo any sharing, unsharing, or deletion you’ve
done.)</p>

<p>Back to the File menu, the Save menu option saves the project to the
same source and same name that was used when opening the project. (If
you opened another user’s shared project or an example project, the
project will be saved to your own cloud account. You must be logged in
to save to the cloud.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image992.png" alt="" />{width=”3.236111111111111in”
height=”2.3493055555555555in”}The Save as… menu option opens a dialog
box in which you can specify where to save the project:</p>

<p>This is much like the Open dialog, except for the horizontal text box at
the top, into which you type a name for the project. You can also
publish, unpublish, share, unshare, and delete projects from here. There
is no Recover button.</p>

<p>The Import… menu option is for bringing some external resource into
the current project, or it can load an entirely separate project, from
your local disk. You can import costumes (any picture format that your
browser supports), sounds (again, any format supported by your browser),
and block libraries or sprites (XML format, previously exported from
Snap<em>!</em> itself). Imported costumes and sounds will belong to the
currently selected sprite; imported blocks are global (for all sprites).
Using the Import option is equivalent to dragging the file from your
desktop onto the Snap<em>!</em> window.</p>

<p>Depending on your browser, the Export project… option either directly
saves to your disk or opens a new browser tab containing your complete
project in XML notation (a plain text format). You can then use the
browser’s Save feature to save the project as an XML file, which should
be named <em>something</em>.xml so that Snap<em>!</em> will recognize it as a project
when you later drag it onto a Snap<em>!</em> window. This is an alternative to
saving the project to your cloud account: keeping it on your own
computer. It is equivalent to choosing Computer from the Save dialog
described earlier.</p>

<p>The Export summary… option creates a web page, in HTML, with all of
the information about your project: its name, its project notes, a
picture of what’s on its stage, definitions of global blocks, and then
per-sprite information: name, wardrobe (list of costumes), and local
variables and block definitions. The page can be converted to PDF by the
browser; it’s intended to meet the documentation requirements of the
Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles create task.</p>

<p>The Export blocks… option is used to create a block library. It
presents a list of all the global (for all sprites) blocks in your
project, and lets you select which to export. It then opens a browser
tab with those blocks in XML format, or stores directly to your local
disk, as with the Export project option. Block libraries can be imported
with the Import option or by dragging the file onto the Snap<em>!</em> window.
This option is shown only if you have defined custom blocks.</p>

<p>The Unused blocks… option presents a listing of all the global custom
blocks in your project that aren’t used anywhere, and offers to delete
them. As with Export blocks, you can choose a subset to delete with
checkboxes. This option is shown only if you have defined custom blocks.</p>

<p>The Hide blocks… option shows <em>all</em> blocks, including primitives, with
checkboxes. This option does not remove any blocks from your project,
but it does hide selected block in your palette. The purpose of the
option is to allow teachers to present students with a simplified
Snap<em>!</em> with some features effectively removed. The hiddenness of
primitives is saved with each project, so students can load a shared
project and see just the desired blocks. But users can always unhide
blocks by choosing this option and unclicking all the checkboxes.
(Right-click in the background of the dialog box to get a menu from
which you can check all boxes or uncheck all boxes.)</p>

<p>The New category… option allows you to add your own categories to the
palette. It opens a dialog box in which you specify a name <em>and a color</em>
for the category. (A lighter version of the same color will be used for
the zebra coloring feature.)</p>

<p>The Remove a category… option appears only if you’ve created custom
categories. It opens a very small, easy-to-miss menu of category names
just under the file icon in the menu bar. If you remove a category that
has blocks in it, all those blocks are also removed.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image993.png" alt="" />{width=”1.1666666666666667in”
height=”0.19791666666666666in”}The next group of options concern the
<em>scenes</em> feature, new in Snap<em>!</em> 7.0. A scene is a complete project,
with its own stage, sprites, and code, but several can be merged into
one project, using the block to bring another scene onscreen. The
Scenes… option presents a menu of all the scenes in your project,
where the File menu was before you clicked it. The New scene option
creates a new, empty scene, which you can rename as you like from its
context menu. Add scene… is like Import… but for scenes. (A complete
project can be imported as a scene into another project, so you have to
specify that you’re importing the project <em>as a scene</em> rather than
replacing the current project.)</p>

<p>The Libraries… option presents a menu of useful, optional block
libraries:<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image385.png" alt="" />{width=”7.401388888888889in”
height=”3.238888888888889in”}</p>

<p>When you click on the one-line description of a library, you are shown
the actual blocks in the library and a longer explanation of its
purpose. You can browse the libraries to find one that will satisfy your
needs. The libraries are described in detail in Section I.H, page 25.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image994.png" alt="" />{width=”4.28125in”
height=”3.2395833333333335in”}The Costumes… option opens a browser
into the costume library:</p>

<p>You can import a single costume by clicking it and then clicking the
Import button. Alternatively, you can import more than one costume by
double-clicking each one, and then clicking Cancel when done. Notice
that some costumes are tagged with “svg” in this picture; those are
vector-format costumes that are not (yet) editable within Snap<em>!</em>.</p>

<p>If you have the stage selected in the sprite corral, rather than a
sprite, the Costumes… option changes to a Backgrounds… option, with
different choices in the browser:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image995.png" alt="" />{width=”4.28125in”
height=”3.2395833333333335in”}The costume and background libraries
include both bitmap (go jagged if enlarged) and vector (enlarge
smoothly) images. Thanks to Scratch 2.0/3.0 for most of these images!
Some older browsers refuse to import a vector image, but instead convert
it to bitmap.</p>

<p>The Sounds… option opens the third kind of media browser:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image996.png" alt="" />{width=”4.28125in”
height=”3.2395833333333335in”}The Play buttons can be used to preview
the sounds.</p>

<p>Finally, the Undelete sprites… option appears only if you have deleted
a sprite; it allows you to recover a sprite that was deleted by accident
(perhaps intending to delete only a costume).</p>

<h3 id="the-cloud-menu">The Cloud Menu</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image997.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4368055555555554in”
height=”0.7597222222222222in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image998.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”

height=”0.1673611111111111in”}The cloud icon shows a menu of options
relating to your Snap<em>!</em> cloud account. If you are not logged in, you
see the outline icon and get this menu:</p>

<p>Choose Login… if you have a Snap<em>!</em> account and remember your
password. Choose Signup… if you don’t have an account. Choose Reset
Password… if you’ve forgotten your password or just want to change it.
You will then get an email, at the address you gave when you created
your account, with a new temporary password. Use that password to log
in, then you can choose your own password, as shown below. Choose Resend
Verification Email… if you have just created a Snap<em>!</em> account but
can’t find the email we sent you with the link to verify that it’s
really your email. (If you still can’t find it, check your spam folder.
If you are using a school email address, your school may block incoming
email from outside the school.) The Open in Community Site option
appears only if you have a project open; it takes you to the community
site page about that project.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1001.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6111111111111112in”
height=”0.6527777777777778in”}If you are already logged in, you’ll see
the solid icon
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1002.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”
height=”0.16666666666666666in”} and get this menu:</p>

<p>Logout is obvious, but has the additional benefit of showing you who’s
logged in. Change password… will ask for your old password (the
temporary one if you’re resetting your password) and the new password
you want, entered twice because it doesn’t echo. Open in Community Site
is the same as above.</p>

<h3 id="the-settings-menu">The Settings Menu</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1003.png" alt="" />{width=”1.2479166666666666in”
height=”2.5833333333333335in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1004.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”
height=”0.16666666666666666in”}The settings icon shows a menu of Snap<em>!</em>
options, either for the current project or for you permanently,
depending on the option:</p>

<p>The Language… option lets you see the Snap<em>!</em> user interface (blocks
and messages) in a language other than English. (Note: Translations have
been provided by Snap<em>!</em> users. If your native language is missing, send
us an email!)</p>

<p>The Zoom blocks... option lets you change the size of blocks, both in
the palettes and in scripts. The standard size is 1.0 units. The main
purpose of this option is to let you take very high-resolution pictures
of scripts for use on posters. It can also be used to improve
readability when projecting onto a screen while lecturing, but bear in
mind that it doesn’t make the palette or script areas any wider, so your
computer’s command-option-+ feature may be more practical. Note that a
zoom of 2 is gigantic! Don’t even try 10.</p>

<p>The Fade blocks… option opens a dialog in which you can change the
appearance of blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1005.png" alt="" />{width=”7.4847222222222225in”
height=”2.577777777777778in”}Mostly this is a propaganda aid to use on
people who think that text languages are somehow better or more grown up
than block languages, but some people do prefer less saturated block
colors. You can use the pulldown menu for preselected fadings, use the
slider to see the result as you change the fading amount, or type a
number into the text box once you’ve determined your favorite value.</p>

<p>The Stage size… option lets you set the size of the <em>full-size</em> stage
in pixels. If the stage is in half-size or double-size (presentation
mode), the stage size values don’t change; they always reflect the
full-size stage.</p>

<p>The Microphone resolution… option sets the buffer size used by the
microphone block in Settings. “Resolution” is an accurate name if you
are getting frequency domain samples; the more samples, the narrower the
range of frequencies in each sample. In the time domain, the buffer size
determines the length of time over which samples are collected.</p>

<p>The remaining options let you turn various features on and off. There
are three groups of checkboxes. The first is for temporary settings not
saved in your project nor in your user preferences.</p>

<p>The JavaScript extensions option enables the use of the JavaScript
function block. Because malicious projects could use JavaScript to
collect private information about you, or to delete or modify your saved
projects, you must enable JavaScript <em>each time</em> you load a project that
uses it.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1015.png" alt="" />{width=”1.1895833333333334in”
height=”0.18958333333333333in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1016.png" alt="" />{width=”1.229861111111111in”
height=”0.25972222222222224in”}The Extension blocks option adds two
blocks to the palette:</p>

<p>These blocks provide assorted capabilities to official libraries that
were formerly implemented with the JavaScript function block. This
allows these libraries to run without requiring the JavaScript
extensions option. Details are subject to change.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1017.png" alt="" />{width=”1.104861111111111in”
height=”2.0833333333333335in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1018.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6388888888888888in”
height=”0.4131944444444444in”}Input sliders provides an alternate way to
put values in numeric input slots; if you click in such a slot, a slider
appears that you can control with the mouse:</p>

<p>The range of the slider will be from 25 less than the input’s current
value to 25 more than the current value. If you want to make a bigger
change than that, you can slide the slider all the way to either end,
then click on the input slot again, getting a new slider with a new
center point. But you won’t want to use this technique to change the
input value from 10 to 1000, and it doesn’t work at all for non-integer
input ranges. This feature was implemented because software keyboard
input on phones and tablets didn’t work at all in the beginning, and
still doesn’t work perfectly on Android devices, so sliders provide a
workaround. It has since found another use in providing “lively”
response to input changes; if Input sliders is checked, reopening the
settings menu will show an additional option called Execute on slider
change. If this option is also checked, then changing a slider in the
scripting area automatically runs the script in which that input
appears. The project live-tree in the Examples collection shows how this
can be used; it features a fractal tree custom block with several
inputs, and you can see how each input affects the picture by moving a
slider.</p>

<p>Turbo mode makes many projects run much faster, at the cost of not
keeping the stage display up to date. (Snap<em>!</em> ordinarily spends most of
its time drawing sprites and updating variable watchers, rather than
actually carrying out the instructions in your scripts.) So turbo mode
isn’t a good idea for a project with glide blocks or one in which the
user interacts with animated characters, but it’s great for drawing a
complicated fractal, or computing the first million digits of 𝜋, so that
you don’t need to see anything until the final result. While in turbo
mode, the button that normally shows a green flag instead shows a green
lightning bolt. (But when ⚑ clicked hat blocks still activate when the
button is clicked.)</p>

<p>Visible stepping enables the slowed-down script evaluation described in
Chapter I. Checking this option is equivalent to clicking the footprint
button above the scripting area. You don’t want this on except when
you’re actively debugging, because even the fastest setting of the
slider is still slowed a lot.</p>

<p>Log pen vectors tells Snap<em>!</em> to remember lines drawn by sprites as
exact vectors, rather than remember only the pixels that the drawing
leaves on the stage. This remembered vector picture can be used in two
ways: First, right-clicking on a pen trails block gives an option to
relabel it into a pen vectors block which, when run, reports the logged
lines as a vector (svg) costume. Second, right-clicking on the stage
when there are logged vectors shows an extra option, svg…, that
exports a picture of the stage in vector format. Only lines are logged,
not color regions made with the fill block.</p>

<p>The next group of four are user preference options, preserved when you
load a new project. Long form input dialog, if checked, means that
whenever a custom block input name is created or edited, you immediately
see the version of the input name dialog that includes the type options,
default value setting, etc., instead of the short form with just the
name and the choice between input name and title text. The default
(unchecked) setting is definitely best for beginners, but more
experienced Snap<em>!</em> programmers may find it more convenient always to
see the long form.</p>

<p>Plain prototype labels eliminates the plus signs between words in the
Block Editor prototype block. This makes it harder to add an input to a
custom block; you have to hover the mouse where the plus sign would have
been, until a single plus sign appears temporarily for you to click on.
It’s intended for people making pictures of scripts in the block editor
for use in documentation, such as this manual. You probably won’t need
it otherwise.</p>

<p>Clicking sound causes a really annoying sound effect whenever one block
snaps next to another in a script. Certain very young children, and our
colleague Dan Garcia, like this, but if you are such a child you should
bear in mind that driving your parents or teachers crazy will result in
you not being allowed to use Snap<em>!</em>. It might, however, be useful for
visually impaired users.</p>

<p>Flat design changes the “skin” of the Snap<em>!</em> window to a really hideous
design with white and pale-grey background, rectangular rather than
rounded buttons, and monochrome blocks (rather than the shaded, somewhat
3D-looking normal blocks). The monochrome blocks are the reason for the
“flat” in the name of this option. The only thing to be said for this
option is that, because of the white background, it may blend in better
with the rest of a web page when a Snap<em>!</em> project is run in a frame in
a larger page. (I confess I used it to make the picture of blocks faded
all the way to just text two pages ago, though.)</p>

<p>The final group of settings change the way Snap<em>!</em> interprets your
program; they are saved with the project, so anyone who runs your
project will experience the same behavior. Thread safe scripts changes
the way Snap<em>!</em> responds when an event (clicking the green flag, say)
starts a script, and then, while the script is still running, the same
event happens again. Ordinarily, the running process stops where it is,
ignoring the remaining commands in the script, and the entire script
starts again from the top. This behavior is inherited from Scratch, and
some converted Scratch projects depend on it; that’s why it’s the
default. It’s also sometimes the right thing, especially in projects
that play music in response to mouse clicks or keystrokes. If a note is
still playing but you ask for another one, you want the new one to start
right then, not later after the old process finishes. But if your script
makes several changes to a database and is interrupted in the middle,
the result may be that the database is inconsistent. When you select
Thread safe scripts, the same event happening again in the middle of
running a script is simply ignored. (This is arguably still not the
right thing; the event should be remembered and the script run again as
soon as it finishes. We’ll probably get around to adding that choice
eventually.) Keyboard events (when __ key pressed) are always
thread-safe.</p>

<p>Flat line ends affects the drawing of thick lines (large pen width).
Usually the ends are rounded, which looks best when turning corners.
With this option selected, the ends are flat. It’s useful for drawing a
brick wall or a filled rectangle.</p>

<p>Codification support enables a feature that can translate a Snap<em>!</em>
project to a text-based (rather than block-based) programming language.
The feature doesn’t know about any particular other language; instead,
you can provide a translation for each primitive block using these
special blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1019.png" alt="" />{width=”3.120644138232721in”
height=”0.5451388888888888in”}</p>

<p>Using these primitive blocks, you can build a block library to translate
into any programming language. Watch for such libraries to be added to
our library collection (or contribute one). To see some examples, open
the project “Codification” in the Examples project list. Edit the blocks
map to Smalltalk, map to JavaScript, etc., to see examples of how to
provide translations for blocks.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1021.png" alt="" />{width=”2.209722222222222in”
height=”4.969444444444444in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1022.png" alt="" />{width=”1.38in”
height=”4.79in”}The Single palette option puts all blocks, regardless of
category, into a single palette. It’s intended mainly for use by
curriculum developers building <em>Parsons problems:</em> projects in which
only a small set of blocks are provided, and the task is to arrange
those blocks to achieve a set goal. In that application, this option is
combined with the hiding of almost all primitive blocks. (See page 119.)
When Single palette is turned on, two additional options (initially on)
appear in the settings menu; the Show categories option controls the
appearance of the palette category names such as
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1023.png" alt="" />{width=”0.36in” height=”0.16in”}
and <img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1024.png" alt="A picture containing logo Description automatically
generated" />{width=”0.33in”
height=”0.18in”}, while the Show buttons option controls the appearance
of the <img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1025.png" alt="" />{width=”0.61in”
height=”0.16in”} and
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1026.png" alt="" />{width=”0.53in” height=”0.16in”}
buttons in the palette.</p>

<p>The HSL pen color model option changes the set pen, change pen, and pen
blocks to provide menu options hue, saturation, and lightness instead of
hue, saturation, and brightness (a/k/a value). Note: the name
“saturation” means something different in HSL from in HSV! See Appendix
A for all the information you need about colors.</p>

<p>The Disable click-to-run option tells Snap<em>!</em> to ignore user mouse
clicks on blocks and scripts if it would ordinarily run the block or
script. (Right-clicking and dragging still work, and so does clicking in
an input slot to edit it.) This is another Parsons problem feature; the
idea is that there will be buttons displayed that run code only in
teacher-approved ways. But kids can uncheck the checkbox. ☺︎</p>

<h3 id="visible-stepping-controls">Visible Stepping Controls</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image121.png" alt="" />{width=”0.37916666666666665in”
height=”0.21666666666666667in”}After the menu buttons you’ll see the
project name. After that comes the footprint button used to turn on
visible stepping and, when it’s on, the slider to control the speed of
stepping.</p>

<h3 id="stage-resizing-buttons">Stage Resizing Buttons</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1027.png" alt="" />{width=”0.37916666666666665in”

height=”0.21666666666666667in”}Still in the tool bar, but above the left
edge of the stage, are two buttons that change the size of the stage.
The first is the shrink/grow button. Normally it looks like this:
Clicking the button displays the stage at half-normal size horizontally
and vertically (so it takes up ¼ of its usual area). When the stage is
half size the button looks like this: and clicking it returns the stage
to normal size. The main reason you’d want a half size stage is during
the development process, when you’re assembling scripts with wide input
expressions and the normal scripting area isn’t wide enough to show the
complete script. You’d typically then switch back to normal size to try
out the project. The next presentation mode button normally looks like
this: Clicking the button makes the stage double size in both dimensions
and eliminates most of the other user interface elements (the palette,
the scripting area, the sprite corral, and most of the tool bar). When
you open a shared project using a link someone has sent you, the project
starts in presentation mode. While in presentation mode, the button
looks like this: Clicking it returns to normal (project development)
mode.</p>

<h3 id="project-control-buttons-project-control-buttons-listparagraph">Project Control Buttons {#project-control-buttons .ListParagraph}</h3>

<p>Above the right edge of the stage are three buttons that control the
running of the project.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1031.png" alt="" />{width=”0.38in”
height=”0.22in”}Technically, the green flag is no more a project control
than anything else that can trigger a hat block: typing on the keyboard
or clicking on a sprite. But it’s a convention that clicking the flag
should start the action of the project from the beginning. It’s only a
convention; some projects have no flag-controlled scripts at all, but
respond to keyboard controls instead. Clicking the green flag also
deletes temporary clones.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1032.png" alt="" />{width=”0.35in”
height=”0.2in”}Whenever any script is running (not necessarily in the
current sprite), the green flag is lit: .</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1033.png" alt="" />{width=”0.35in”
height=”0.2in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1034.png" alt="" />{width=”1.3590277777777777in”
height=”0.8840277777777777in”}Shift-clicking the button enters Turbo
mode, and the button then looks like a lightning bolt: . Shift-clicking
again turns Turbo mode off.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1038.png" alt="" />{width=”0.37916666666666665in”
height=”0.21666666666666667in”}Scripts can simulate clicking the green
flag by broadcasting the special message
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1039.png" alt="" />{width=”0.3055555555555556in”
height=”0.3055555555555556in”}.</p>

height=”0.21666666666666667in”}The pause button suspends running all
scripts. If clicked while scripts are running, the button changes shape
to become a play button: Clicking it while in this form resumes the
suspended scripts. There is also a pause all block in the Control
palette that can be inserted in a script to suspend all scripts; this
provides the essence of a breakpoint debugging capability. The use of
the pause button is slightly different in visible stepping mode,
described in Chapter I.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1042.png" alt="" />{width=”0.5486111111111112in”
height=”0.17708333333333334in”}The stop button stops all scripts, like
the stop all block. It does <em>not</em> prevent a script from starting again
in response to a click or keystroke; the user interface is always
active. There is one exception: generic when blocks will not fire after
a stop until some non-generic event starts a script. The stop button
also deletes all temporary clones.</p>

<h2 id="the-palette-area">The Palette Area</h2>

<p>At the top of the palette area are the eight buttons that select which
palette (which block category) is shown: Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen,
Control, Sensing, Operators, and Variables (which also includes the List
and Other blocks). There are no menus behind these buttons.</p>

<h3 id="buttons-in-the-palette">Buttons in the Palette</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1043.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2604166666666667in”
height=”0.2604166666666667in”}Under the eight palette selector buttons,
at the top of the actual palette, are two semi-transparent buttons. The
first is the <em>search</em> button, which is equivalent to typing control-F:
It replaces the palette with a search bar into which you can type part
of the title text of the block you’re trying to find. To leave this
search mode, click one of the eight palette selectors, or type the
Escape key.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1044.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2604166666666667in”
height=”0.2604166666666667in”}The other button is equivalent to the
“Make a block” button, except that the dialog window that it opens has
the current palette (color) preselected.</p>

<h3 id="context-menus-for-palette-blocks">Context Menus for Palette Blocks</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1045.png" alt="" />{width=”0.8611111111111112in”
height=”0.45902777777777776in”}Most elements of the Snap<em>!</em> display can
be control-clicked/right-clicked to show a <em>context menu,</em> with items
relevant to that element. If you control-click/right-click a <em>primitive</em>
block in the palette, you see this menu:</p>

<p>The help… option displays a box with documentation about the block.
Here’s an example:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1046.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6229166666666666in”
height=”0.8888888888888888in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1047.png" alt="" />{width=”3.3222222222222224in”
height=”2.4277777777777776in”}If you control-click/right-click a
<em>custom</em> (user-defined) block in the palette, you see this menu:</p>

<p>The help… option for a custom block displays the comment, if any,
attached to the custom block’s hat block in the Block Editor. Here is an
example of a block with a comment and its help display:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1048.png" alt="" />{width=”6.758333333333334in”
height=”2.451388888888889in”}If the help text includes a URL, it is
clickable and will open the page in a new tab.</p>

<p>The delete block definition… option asks for confirmation, then
deletes the custom block and removes it from any scripts in which it
appears. (The result of this removal may not leave a sensible script;
it’s best to find and correct such scripts <em>before</em> deleting a block.)
Note that there is no option to <em>hide</em> a custom block; this can be done
in the Block Editor by right-clicking on the hat block.</p>

<p>The duplicate block definition… option makes a <em>copy</em> of the block and
opens that copy in the Block Editor. Since you can’t have two custom
blocks with the same title text and input types, the copy is created
with “(2)” (or a higher number if necessary) at the end of the block
prototype.</p>

<p>The export block definition… option writes a file in your browser’s
downloads directory containing the definition of this block and any
other custom blocks that this block invokes, directly or indirectly. So
the resulting file can be loaded later without the risk of red
Undefined! blocks because of missing dependencies.</p>

<p>The edit… option opens a Block Editor with the definition of the
custom block.</p>

<h3 id="context-menu-for-the-palette-background">Context Menu for the Palette Background</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1052.png" alt="" />{width=”0.9895833333333334in”
height=”0.5895833333333333in”}Right-click/control-click on the grey
<em>background</em> of the palette area shows this menu:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1053.png" alt="" />{width=”1.6in”
height=”2.1597222222222223in”}The find blocks… option does the same
thing as the magnifying-glass button. The hide blocks… option opens a
dialog box in which you can choose which blocks (custom as well as
primitive) should be hidden. (Within that dialog box, the context menu
of the background allows you to check or uncheck all the boxes at once.)</p>

<p>The make a category… option, which is intended mainly for authors of
snap extensions, lets you add custom <em>categories</em> to the palette. It
opens a small dialog window in which you specify a name <em>and a color</em>
for the new category:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1054.png" alt="" />{width=”1.429861111111111in”
height=”2.9097222222222223in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1055.png" alt="" />{width=”1.53in”
height=”1.13in”}Pick a dark color, because it will be lightened for
zebra coloring when users nest blocks of the same category. Custom
categories are shown below the built-in categories in the category
selector:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1056.png" alt="" />{width=”1.35in”
height=”1.8395833333333333in”}This example comes from Eckart Modrow’s
SciSnap<em>!</em> library. Note that the custom category list has its own
scroll bar, which appears if you have more than six custom categories.
Note also that the buttons to select a custom category occupy the full
width of the palette area, unlike the built-in categories, which occupy
only half of the width. Custom categories are listed in alphabetical
order; this is why Prof. Modrow chose to start each category name with a
number, so that he could control their order.</p>

<p>If there are no blocks visible in a category, the category name is
dimmed in the category selector:</p>

<p>Here we see that category foo has blocks in it, but categories bar and
garply are empty. The built-in categories are also subject to dimming,
if all of the blocks of a category are hidden.</p>

<p><strong><br />
Palette Resizing</strong></p>

<p>At the right end of the palette area, just to the left of the scripting
area, is a resizing
handle<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1057.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4166666666666667in”
height=”1.5138888888888888in”} that can be dragged rightward to increase
the width of the palette area. This is useful if you write custom blocks
with very long names. You can’t reduce the width of the palette below
its standard value.</p>

<h2 id="the-scripting-area">The Scripting Area</h2>

<p>The scripting area is the middle vertical region of the Snap<em>!</em> window,
containing scripts and also some controls for the appearance and
behavior of a sprite. There is always a <em>current sprite,</em> whose scripts
are shown in the scripting area. A dark grey rounded rectangle in the
sprite corral shows which sprite (or the stage) is current. Note that
it’s only the visible <em>display</em> of the scripting area that is “current”
for a sprite; all scripts of all sprites may be running at the same
time. Clicking on a sprite thumbnail in the sprite corral makes it
current. The stage itself can be selected as current, in which case the
appearance is different, with some primitives not shown.</p>

<h3 id="sprite-appearance-and-behavior-controls">Sprite Appearance and Behavior Controls</h3>

<p>At the top of the scripting area are a picture of the sprite and some
controls for it:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1058.png" alt="" />{width=”3.486111111111111in”
height=”1.0416666666666667in”}</p>

<p>Note that the sprite picture reflects its rotation, if any. There are
three things that can be controlled here:</p>

<p>1. The three circular buttons in a column at the left control the
sprite’s <em>rotation</em> behavior. Sprite costumes are designed to be
right-side-up when the sprite is facing toward the right (direction =
90). If the topmost button is lit, the default as shown in the picture
above, then the sprite’s costume rotates as the sprite changes
direction. If the middle button is selected, then the costume is
reversed left-right when the sprite’s direction is roughly leftward
(direction between 180 and 359, or equivalently, between -180 and -1).
If the bottom button is selected, the costume’s orientation does not
change regardless of the sprite’s direction.</p>

<p>2. The sprite’s <em>name</em> can be changed in the text box that, in this
picture, says “Sprite.”</p>

<p>3. Finally, if the draggable checkbox is checked, then the user can move
the sprite on the stage by clicking and dragging it. The common use of
this feature is in game projects, in which some sprites are meant to be
under the player’s control but others are not.</p>

<h3 id="scripting-area-tabs">Scripting Area Tabs</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1059.png" alt="" />{width=”3.0972222222222223in”
height=”0.25in”}Just below the sprite controls are three <em>tabs</em> that
determine what is shown in the scripting area:</p>

<h3 id="scripts-and-blocks-within-scripts">Scripts and Blocks Within Scripts</h3>

<p>Most of what’s described in this section also applies to blocks and
scripts in a Block Editor.</p>

<p>Clicking on a script (which includes a single unattached block) runs it.
If the script starts with a hat block, clicking on the script runs it
even if the event in the hat block doesn’t happen. (This is a useful
debugging technique when you have a dozen sprites and they each have
five scripts with green-flag hat blocks, and you want to know what a
single one of those scripts does.) The script will have a green “halo”
around it while it’s running. If the script is shared with clones, then
while it has the green halo it will also have a count of how many
instances of the script are running. Clicking a script with such a halo
<em>stops</em> the script. (If the script includes a warp block, which might be
inside a custom block used in the script, then Snap<em>!</em> may not respond
immediately to clicks.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1060.png" alt="" />{width=”0.3333333333333333in”
height=”0.2604166666666667in”}If a script is shown with a <em>red</em> halo,
that means that an error was caught in that script, such as using a list
where a number was needed, or vice versa. Clicking the script will turn
off the halo.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1061.png" alt="" />{width=”0.3125in”
height=”0.23958333333333334in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1062.png" alt="" />{width=”0.3333333333333333in”
height=”0.2604166666666667in”}If any blocks have been dragged into the
scripting area, then in its top right corner you’ll see an <em>undo</em> and/or
<em>redo</em> button that can be used to undo or redo block and script drops.
When you undo a drop into an input slot, whatever used to be in the slot
is restored. The redo button appears once you’ve used undo.</p>

<p>The third button starts keyboard editing mode (Section D, page 130).</p>

<p>Control-click/right-clicking a primitive block within a script shows a
menu like this one:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1063.png" alt="" />{width=”0.6208333333333333in”
height=”1.0625in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1064.png" alt="" />{width=”0.6263888888888889in”
height=”1.0902777777777777in”}</p>

<p>command block: reporter block:</p>

<p>The help… option shows the help screen for the block, just as in the
palette. The other options appear only when a block is
right-clicked/control-clicked in the scripting area.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1065.png" alt="" />{width=”1.53in”
height=”2.13in”}Not every primitive block has a relabel… option. When
present, it allows the block to be replaced by another, similar block,
keeping the input expressions in place. For example, here’s what happens
when you choose relabel… for an arithmetic operator:</p>

<p>Note that the inputs to the existing – block are displayed in the menu
of alternatives also. Click a block in the menu to choose it, or click
outside the menu to keep the original block. Note that the last three
choices are not available in the palette; you must use the relabel
feature to access them.</p>

<p>Not every reporter has a compile option; it exists only for the higher
order functions. When selected, a lightning bolt appears before the
block name:
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1066.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4027777777777777in”
height=”0.2013888888888889in”} and Snap<em>!</em> tries to compile the function
inside the ring to JavaScript, so it runs at primitive speed. This works
only for simple functions (but the higher order function still works
even if the compilation doesn’t). The function to be compiled must be
quick, because it will be uninterruptable; in particular, if it’s an
infinite loop, you may have to quit your browser to recover. Therefore,
<strong>save your project before</strong> you experiment with the compilation
feature. The right-click menu for a compiled higher order function will
have an uncompile option. This is an experimental feature.</p>

<p>The duplicate option for a command block makes a copy of the <em>entire
script</em> starting from the selected block. For a reporter, it copies only
that reporter and its inputs. The copy is attached to the mouse, and you
can drag it to another script (or even to another Block Editor window),
even though you are no longer holding down the mouse button. Click the
mouse to drop the script copy.</p>

<p>The block picture underneath the word duplicate for a command block is
another duplication option, but it duplicates only the selected block,
not everything under it in the script. Note that if the selected block
is a C-shaped control block, the script inside its C-shaped slot is
included. If the block is at the end of its script, this option does not
appear. (Use duplicate instead.)</p>

<p>The extract option removes the selected block from the script and leaves
you holding it with the mouse. In other words, it’s like the block
picture option, but it doesn’t leave a copy of the block in the original
script. If the block is at the end of its script, this option does not
appear. (Just grab the block with the mouse.) A shorthand for this
operation is to <em>shift-click</em> and drag out the block.</p>

<p>The delete option deletes the selected block from the script.</p>

<p>The add comment option creates a comment, like the same option in the
background of the scripting area, but attaches it to the block you
clicked.</p>

<p>The script pic… option saves a picture of the entire script, not just
from the selected block to the end, into your download folder; or, in
some browsers, opens a new browser tab containing the picture. In the
latter case, you can use the browser’s Save feature to put the picture
in a file. This is a super useful feature if you happen to be writing a
Snap<em>!</em> manual! (If you have a Retina display, consider turning off
Retina support before making script pictures; if not, they end up huge.)
For reporters not inside a script, there is an additional result pic…
option that calls the reporter and includes a speech balloon with the
result in the picture. Note: The downloaded file is a “smart picture”:
It also contains the code of the script, as if you’d exported the
project. If you later drag the file into the costumes tab, it will be
loaded as a costume. But if you drag it into the <em>scripts</em> tab, it will
be loaded as a script, which you can drop wherever you want it in the
scripting area.</p>

<p>If the script does <em>not</em> start with a hat block, or you clicked on a
reporter, then there’s one more option: ringify (and, if there is
already a grey ring around the block or script, unringify). Ringify
surrounds the block (reporter) or the entire script (command) with a
grey ring, meaning that the block(s) inside the ring are themselves
data, as an input to a higher order procedure, rather than something to
be evaluated within the script. See Chapter VI, Procedures as Data.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1067.png" alt="" />{width=”0.9736111111111111in”
height=”1.2986111111111112in”}Clicking a <em>custom</em> block in a script
gives a similar but different menu:</p>

<p>The relabel… option for custom blocks shows a menu of other same-shape
custom blocks with the same inputs. At present you can’t relabel a
custom block to a primitive block or vice versa. The two options at the
bottom, for custom blocks only, are the same as in the palette. The
other options are the same as for primitive commands.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1068.png" alt="" />{width=”0.88125in”
height=”1.0833333333333333in”}If a reporter block is in the scripting
area, possibly with inputs included, but not itself serving as input to
another block, then the menu is a little different again:</p>

<p>What’s new here is the result pic… option. It’s like script pic… but
it includes in the picture a speech balloon with the result of calling
the block.</p>

<p>Broadcast and broadcast and wait blocks in the scripting area have an
additional option: receivers…. When clicked, it causes a momentary (be
looking for it when you click!) halo around the picture in the sprite
corral of those sprites that have a when I receive hat block for the
same message. Similarly, when I receive blocks have a senders… option
that light up the sprite corral icons of sprites that broadcast the same
message.</p>

<p><strong>Scripting Area Background Context Menu</strong></p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1069.png" alt="" />{width=”1.2895833333333333in”
height=”1.2777777777777777in”}Control-click/right-click on the grey
striped background of the scripting area gives this menu:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1062.png" alt="" />{width=”0.8416666666666667in”
height=”0.18819444444444444in”}The undrop option is a sort of “undo”
feature for the common case of dropping a block somewhere other than
where you meant it to go. It remembers all the dragging and dropping
you’ve done in this sprite’s scripting area (that is, other sprites have
their own separate drop memory), and undoes the most recent, returning
the block to its former position, and restoring the previous value in
the relevant input slot, if any. Once you’ve undropped something, the
redrop option appears, and allows you to repeat the operation you just
undid. These menu options are equivalent to the and buttons described
earlier.</p>

<p>The clean up option rearranges the position of scripts so that they are
in a single column, with the same left margin, and with uniform spacing
between scripts. This is a good idea if you can’t read your own project!</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1072.png" alt="" />{width=”1.3888888888888888in”
height=”0.7083333333333334in”}The add comment option puts a comment box,
like the picture to the right, in the scripting area. It’s attached to
the mouse, as with duplicating scripts, so you position the mouse where
you want the comment and click to release it. You can then edit the text
in the comment as desired.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1073.png" alt="" />{width=”1.3888888888888888in”
height=”0.2361111111111111in”}You can drag the bottom right corner of
the comment box to resize it. Clicking the arrowhead at the top left
changes the box to a single-line compact form, , so that you can have a
number of collapsed comments in the scripting area and just expand one
of them when you want to read it in full.</p>

<p>If you drag a comment over a block in a script, the comment will be
attached to the block with a yellow line:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1074.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4861111111111112in”

height=”0.9333333333333333in”}Comments have their own context menu, with
obvious meanings:</p>

<p>Back to the options in the menu for the background of the scripting area
(picture on the previous page):</p>

<p>The scripts pic… option saves, or opens a new browser tab with, a
picture of <em>all</em> scripts in the scripting area, just as they appear, but
without the grey striped background. Note that “all scripts in the
scripting area” means just the top-level scripts of the current sprite,
not other sprites’ scripts or custom block definitions. This is also a
“smart picture”; if you drag it into the scripting area, it will <em>create
a new sprite</em> with those scripts in its scripting area.</p>

<p>Finally, the make a block… option does the same thing as the “Make a
block” button in the palettes. It’s a shortcut so that you don’t have to
keep scrolling down the palette if you make a lot of blocks.</p>

<h3 id="controls-in-the-costumes-tab">Controls in the Costumes Tab</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1076.png" alt="" />{width=”1.9631944444444445in”
height=”2.1319444444444446in”}If you click on the word “Costumes” under
the sprite controls, you’ll see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1077.png" alt="" />{width=”0.37916666666666665in”
height=”0.21666666666666667in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1078.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”
height=”0.16666666666666666in”}The Turtle costume is always present in
every sprite; it is costume number 0. Other costumes can be painted
within Snap<em>!</em> or imported from files or other browser tabs if your
browser supports that. Clicking on a costume selects it; that is, the
sprite will look like the selected costume. Clicking on the paint brush
icon<br />
opens the <em>Paint Editor,</em> in which you can create a new costume.
Clicking on the camera icon opens a window in which you see what your
computer’s camera is seeing, and you can take a picture (which will be
the full size of the stage unless you shrink it in the Paint Editor).
This works only if you give Snap<em>!</em> permission to use the camera, and
maybe only if you opened Snap<em>!</em> in secure (HTTPS) mode, and then only
if your browser loves you.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1079.png" alt="" />{width=”3.5694444444444446in”
height=”3.1805555555555554in”} <em>Brian’s bedroom when he’s staying at
Paul’s house.</em></p>

<p>Control-clicking/right-clicking on the turtle picture gives this menu:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1080.png" alt="" />{width=”1.0555555555555556in”
height=”0.9027777777777778in”}In this menu, you choose the turtle’s
<em>rotation point,</em> which is also the point from which the turtle draws
lines. The two pictures below show what the stage looks like after
drawing a square in each mode; tip (otherwise known as “Jens mode”) is
on the left in the pictures below, middle (“Brian mode”) on the right:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1081.png" alt="" />{width=”3.134027777777778in”
height=”1.1743055555555555in”}As you see, “tip” means the front tip of
the arrowhead; “middle” is not the middle of the shaded region, but
actually the middle of the four vertices, the concave one. (If the shape
were a simple isosceles triangle instead of a fancier arrowhead, it
would mean the midpoint of the back edge.) The advantage of tip mode is
that the sprite is less likely to obscure the drawing. The advantage of
middle mode is that the rotation point of a sprite is rarely at a tip,
and students are perhaps less likely to be confused about just what will
happen if you ask the turtle to turn 90 degrees from the position shown.
(It’s also the traditional rotation point of the Logo turtle, which
originated this style of drawing.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1085.png" alt="" />{width=”0.9833333333333333in”
height=”1.3194444444444444in”}Costumes other than the turtle have a
different context menu:</p>

<p>The edit option opens the Paint Editor on this costume. The rename
option opens a dialog box in which you can rename the costume. (A
costume’s initial name comes from the file from which it was imported,
if any, or is something like costume5.) Duplicate makes a copy of the
costume, in the same sprite. (Presumably you’d do that because you
intend to edit one of the copies.) Delete is obvious. The get blocks
option appears only for a smart costume, and brings its script to the
scripting area. The export option saves the costume as a file on your
computer, in your usual downloads folder.</p>

<p>You can drag costumes up and down in the Costumes tab in order to
renumber them, so that next costume will behave as you prefer.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1086.png" alt="" />{width=”1.2804921259842519in”
height=”0.8694444444444445in”}If you drag a <em>smart picture</em> of a script
into the Costumes tab, its icon will display the text “&lt;/&gt;” in the
corner to remind you that it includes code:</p>

<p>Its right-click menu will have an extra get blocks option that switches
to the Scripts tab with the script ready to be dropped there.</p>

<h3 id="the-paint-editor">The Paint Editor</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1088.png" alt="" />{width=”3.938888888888889in”
height=”2.577777777777778in”}Here is a picture of a Paint Editor window:</p>

<p>If you’ve used any painting program, most of this will be familiar to
you. Currently, costumes you import can be edited only if they are in a
bitmap format (png, jpeg, gif, etc.). There is a vector editor, but it
works only for creating a costume, not editing an imported vector (svg)
picture. Unlike the case of the Block Editor, only one Paint Editor
window can be open at a time.</p>

<p>The ten square buttons in two rows of five near the top left of the
window are the <em>tools.</em> The top row, from left to right, are the
paintbrush tool, the outlined rectangle tool, the outlined ellipse tool,
the eraser tool, and the rotation point tool. The bottom row tools are
the line drawing tool, the solid rectangle tool, the solid ellipse tool,
the floodfill tool, and the eyedropper tool. Below the tools is a row of
four buttons that immediately change the picture. The first two change
its overall size; the next two flip the picture around horizontally or
vertically. Below these are a color palette, a greyscale tape, and
larger buttons for black, white, and transparent paint. Below these is a
solid bar displaying the currently selected color. Below that is a
picture of a line showing the brush width for painting and drawing, and
below that, you can set the width either with a slider or by typing a
number (in pixels) into the text box. Finally, the checkbox constrains
the line tool to draw horizontally or vertically, the rectangle tools to
draw squares, and the ellipse tools to draw circles. You can get the
same effect temporarily by holding down the shift key, which makes a
check appear in the box as long as you hold it down. (But the Caps Lock
key doesn’t affect it.)</p>

<p>You can correct errors with the undo button, which removes the last
thing you drew, or the clear button, which erases the entire picture.
(Note, it does <em>not</em> revert to what the costume looked like before you
started editing it! If that’s what you want, click the Cancel button at
the bottom of the editor.) When you’re finished editing, to keep your
changes, click OK.</p>

<p>Note that the ellipse tools work more intuitively than ones in other
software you may have used. Instead of dragging between opposite corners
of the rectangle circumscribing the ellipse you want, so that the
endpoints of your dragging have no obvious connection to the actual
shape, in Snap<em>!</em> you start at the center of the ellipse you want and
drag out to the edge. When you let go of the button, the mouse cursor
will be on the curve. If you drag out from the center at 45 degrees to
the axes, the resulting curve will be a circle; if you drag more
horizontally or vertically, the ellipse will be more eccentric. (Of
course if you want an exact circle you can hold down the shift key or
check the checkbox.) The rectangle tools, though, work the way you
expect: You start at one corner of the desired rectangle and drag to the
opposite corner.</p>

<p>Using the eyedropper tool, you can click anywhere in the Snap<em>!</em> window,
even outside the Paint Editor, and the tool will select the color at the
mouse cursor for use in the Paint Editor. You can only do this once,
because the Paint Editor automatically selects the paintbrush when you
choose a color. (Of course you can click on the eyedropper tool button
again.)</p>

<p>The only other non-obvious tool is the rotation point tool. It shows in
the Paint Editor where the sprite’s current rotation center is (the
point around which it turns when you use a turn block); if you click or
drag in the picture, the rotation point will move where you click.
(You’d want to do this, for example, if you want a character to be able
to wave its arm, so you use two sprites connected together. You want the
rotation point of the arm sprite to be at the end where it joins the
body, so it remains attached to the shoulder while waving.)</p>

height=”0.2152777777777778in”}The vector editor’s controls are much like
those in the bitmap editor. One point of difference is that the bitmap
editor has two buttons for solid and outline rectangles, and similarly
for ellipses, but in the vector editor there is always an edge color and
a fill color, even if the latter is “transparent paint,” and so only one
button per shape is needed. Since each shape that you draw is a separate
layer (like sprites on the stage), there are controls to move the
selected shape up (frontward) or down (rearward) relative to other
shapes. There is a selection tool to drag out a rectangular area and
select all the shapes within that area.</p>

<h3 id="controls-in-the-sounds-tab">Controls in the Sounds Tab</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1093.png" alt="" />{width=”0.35in”
height=”0.2in”}There is no Sound Editor in Snap<em>!</em>, and also no current
sound the way there’s a current costume for each sprite. (The sprite
always has an appearance unless hidden, but it doesn’t sing unless
explicitly asked.) So the context menu for sounds has only rename,
delete, and export options, and it has a clickable button labeled Play
or Stop as appropriate. There is a sound <em>recorder,</em> which appears if
you click the red record button ( ):</p>

height=”1.0333333333333334in”}The first, round button starts recording.
The second, square button stops recording. The third, triangular button
plays back a recorded sound. If you don’t like the result, click the
round button again to re-record. When you’re satisfied, push the Save
button. If you need a sound editor, consider the free (both senses)

<h2 id="keyboard-editing">Keyboard Editing</h2>

<p>An ongoing area of research is how to make visual programming languages
usable by people with visual or motoric disabilities. As a first step in
this direction, we provide a keyboard editor, so that you can create and
edit scripts without tracking the mouse. So far, not every user
interface element is controllable by keyboard, and we haven’t even begun
providing <em>output</em> support, such as interfacing with a speech
synthesizer. This is an area in which we know we have a long way to go!
But it’s a start. The keyboard editor may also be useful to anyone who
can type faster than they can drag blocks.</p>

<h3 id="starting-and-stopping-the-keyboard-editor">Starting and stopping the keyboard editor</h3>

<p>There are three ways to start the keyboard editor. Shift-clicking
anywhere in the scripting area will start the editor at that point:
either editing an existing script or, if you shift-click on the
background of the scripting area, editing a new script at the mouse
position. Alternatively, typing shift-enter will start the editor on an
existing script, and you can use the tab key to switch to another
script. Or you can click the keyboard button at the top of the scripting
area.</p>

<p>When the script editor is running, its position is represented by a
blinking white bar:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1095.png" alt="" />{width=”2.2083333333333335in”
height=”1.59375in”}To leave the keyboard editor, type the escape key, or
just click on the background of the scripting area.</p>

<h3 id="navigating-in-the-keyboard-editor">Navigating in the keyboard editor</h3>

<p>To move to a different script, type the tab key. Shift-tab to move
through the scripts in reverse order.</p>

<p>A script is a vertical stack of command blocks. A command block may have
input slots, and each input slot may have a reporter block in it; the
reporter may itself have input slots that may have other reporters. You
can navigate through a script quickly by using the up arrow and down
arrow keys to move between command blocks. Once you find the command
block that you want to edit, the left and right arrow keys move between
editable items within that command. (Left and right arrow when there are
no more editable items within the current command block will move up or
down to another command block, respectively.) Here is a sequence of
pictures showing the results of repeated right arrow keys starting from
the position shown above:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1096.png" alt="" />{width=”7.313888888888889in”
height=”1.2527777777777778in”}You can rearrange scripts within the
scripting area from the keyboard. Typing shift-arrow keys (left, right,
up, or down) will move the current script. If you move it onto another
script, the two won’t snap together; the one you’re moving will overlap
the one already there. This means that you can move across another
script to get to a free space.</p>

<h3 id="editing-a-script">Editing a script</h3>

<p>Note that the keyboard editor <em>focus,</em> the point shown as a white bar or
halo, is either <em>between</em> two command blocks or <em>on</em> an input slot. The
editing keys do somewhat different things in each of those two cases.</p>

<p>The backspace key deletes a block. If the focus is between two commands,
the one <em>before</em> (above) the blinking bar is deleted. If the focus is on
an input slot, the reporter in that slot is deleted. (If that input slot
has a default value, it will appear in the slot.) If the focus is on a
<em>variadic</em> input (one that can change the number of inputs by clicking
on arrowheads), then <em>one</em> input slot is deleted. (When you right-arrow
into a variadic input, the focus first covers the entire thing,
including the arrowheads; another right-arrow focuses on the first slot
within that input group. The focus is “on the variadic input” when it
covers the entire thing.)</p>

<p>The enter key does nothing if the focus is between commands, or on a
reporter. If the focus is on a variadic input, the enter key adds one
more input slot. If the focus is on a white input slot (one that doesn’t
have a reporter in it), then the enter key selects that input slot for
<em>editing;</em> that is, you can type into it, just as if you’d clicked on
the input slot. (Of course, if the focus is on an input slot containing
a reporter, you can use the backspace key to delete that reporter, and
then use the enter key to type a value into it.) When you finish typing
the value, type the enter key again to accept it and return to
navigation, or the escape key if you decide not to change the value
already in the slot.</p>

<p>The space key is used to see a menu of possibilities for the input slot
in focus. It does nothing unless the focus is on a single input slot. If
the focus is on a slot with a pulldown menu of options, then the space
key shows that menu. (If it’s a block-colored slot, meaning that only
the choices in the menu can be used, the enter key will do the same
thing. But if it’s a white slot with a menu, such as in the turn blocks,
then enter lets you type a value, while space shows the menu.)
Otherwise, the space key shows a menu of variables available at this
point in the script. In either case, use the up and down arrow keys to
navigate the menu, use the enter key to accept the highlighted entry, or
use the escape key to leave the menu without choosing an option.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1104.png" alt="" />{width=”1.5347222222222223in”
height=”1.6944444444444444in”}Typing any other character key (not
special keys on fancy keyboards that do something other than generating
a character) activates the <em>block search palette.</em> This palette, which
is also accessible by typing control-F or command-F outside the keyboard
editor, or by clicking the search button floating at the top of the
palette, has a text entry field at the top, followed by blocks whose
title text includes what you type. The character key you typed to start
the block search palette is entered into the text field, so you start
with a palette of blocks containing that character. Within the palette,
blocks whose titles <em>start</em> with the text you type come first, then
blocks in which <em>a word</em> of the title starts with the text you type, and
finally blocks in which the text appears inside a word of the title.
Once you have typed enough text to see the block you want, use the arrow
keys to navigate to that block in the palette, then enter to insert that
block, or escape to leave the block search palette without inserting the
block. (When not in the keyboard editor, instead of navigating with the
arrow keys, you drag the block you want into the script, as you would
from any other palette.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1105.png" alt="" />{width=”2.8333333333333335in”
height=”0.8409722222222222in”}If you type an arithmetic operator (+-*/)
or comparison operator (&lt;=&gt;) into the block search text box, you can
type an arbitrarily complicated expression, and a collection of
arithmetic operator blocks will be constructed to match:</p>

<p>As the example shows, you can also use parentheses for grouping, and
non-numeric operands are treated as variables or primitive functions. (A
variable name entered in this way may or may not already exist in the
script. Only round and the ones in the pulldown menu of the sqrt block
can be used as function names.)</p>

<h3 id="running-the-selected-script">Running the selected script</h3>

<p>Type control-shift-enter to run the script with the editor focus, like
clicking the script.</p>

<h2 id="controls-on-the-stage">Controls on the Stage</h2>

<p>The stage is the area in the top right of the Snap<em>!</em> window in which
sprites move.</p>

<h3 id="sprites">Sprites</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1106.png" alt="" />{width=”0.6013888888888889in”
height=”1.0833333333333333in”}Most sprites can be moved by clicking and
dragging them. (If you have unchecked the draggable checkbox for a
sprite, then dragging it has no effect.) Control-clicking/right-clicking
a sprite shows this context menu:</p>

<p>The duplicate option makes another sprite with copies of the same
scripts, same costumes, etc., as this sprite. The new sprite starts at a
randomly chosen position different from the original, so you can see
quickly which is which. The new sprite is <em>selected:</em> It becomes the
current sprite, the one shown in the scripting area. The clone option
makes a permanent clone of this sprite, with some shared attributes, and
selects it.</p>

<p>The delete option deletes the sprite. It’s not just hidden; it’s gone
for good. (But you can undelete it by clicking the wastebasket just
below the right edge of the stage.) The edit option selects the sprite.
It doesn’t actually change anything about the sprite, despite the name;
it’s just that making changes in the scripting area will change this
sprite.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1107.png" alt="" />{width=”0.6527777777777778in”
height=”0.8888888888888888in”}The move option shows a “move handle”
inside the sprite (the diagonal striped square in the middle):</p>

<p>You can ordinarily just grab and move the sprite without this option,
but there are two reasons you might need it: First, it works even if the
“draggable” checkbox above the scripting area is unchecked. Second, it
works for part sprites relative to their anchor; ordinarily, dragging a
part moves the entire nested sprite.</p>

<p>The rotate option displays a rotation menu:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1108.png" alt="" />{width=”0.9333333333333333in”
height=”1.5833333333333333in”}You can choose one of the four compass
directions in the lower part (the same as in the point in direction
block) or use the mouse to rotate the handle on the dial in 15°
increments.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1109.png" alt="" />{width=”0.6527777777777778in”
height=”0.8472222222222222in”}The pivot option shows a crosshair inside
the sprite:</p>

<p>You can click and drag the crosshair anywhere onstage to set the
costume’s pivot point. (If you move it outside the sprite, then turning
the sprite will revolve as well as rotate it around the pivot.) When
done, click on the stage not on the crosshair. Note that, unlike moving
the pivot point in the Paint Editor, this technique does not visibly
move the sprite on the stage. Instead, the values of x position and y
position will change.</p>

<p>The edit option makes this the selected sprite, highlighting it in the
sprite corral and showing its scripting area. If the sprite was a
temporary clone, it becomes permanent.</p>

<p>The export… option saves, or opens a new browser tab containing, the
XML text representation of the sprite. (Not just its costume, but all of
its costumes, scripts, local variables and blocks, and other
properties.) You can save this tab into a file on your computer, and
later import the sprite into another project. (In some browsers, the
sprite is directly saved into a file.)</p>

<h3 id="width09583333333333334in-height14479166666666667invariable-watchers"><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1110.png" alt="" />{width=”0.9583333333333334in” height=”1.4479166666666667in”}Variable watchers</h3>

<p>Right-clicking on a variable watcher shows this menu:</p>

<p>The first section of the menu lets you choose one of three
visualizations of the watcher:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1111.png" alt="" />{width=”2.3159722222222223in”
height=”0.3263888888888889in”}</p>

<p>The first (normal) visualization is for debugging. The second (large) is
for displaying information to the user of a project, often the score in
a game. And the third (slider) is for allowing the user to control the
program behavior interactively. When the watcher is displayed as a
slider, the middle section of the menu allows you to control the range
of values possible in the slider. It will take the minimum value when
the slider is all the way to the left, the maximum value when all the
way to the right.</p>

<p>The third section of the menu allows data to be passed between your
computer and the variable. The import… option will read a computer
text file. Its name must end with .txt, in which case the text is read
into the variable as is, or .csv or .json, in which case the text is
converted into a list structure, which will always be a two-dimensional
array for csv (comma-separated values) data, but can be any shape for
json data. The raw data… option prevents that conversion to list form.
The export… option does the opposite conversion, passing a text-valued
variable value into a .txt file unchanged, but converting a list value
into csv format if the list is one- or two-dimensional, or into json
format if the list is more complicated. (The scalar values within the
list must be numbers and/or text; lists of blocks, sprites, costumes,
etc. cannot be exported.)</p>

<p>An alternative to using the import… option is simply to drag the file
onto the Snap<em>!</em> window, in which case a variable will be created if
necessary with the same name as the file (but without the extension).</p>

<p>If the value of the variable is a list, then the menu will include an
additional blockify option; clicking it will generate an expression with
nested list blocks that, if evaluated, will reconstruct the list. It’s
useful if you imported a list and then want to write code that will
construct the same list later.</p>

<h3 id="the-stage-itself">The stage itself</h3>

<p>Control-clicking/right-clicking on the stage background (that is,
anywhere on the stage except on a sprite or watcher) shows the stage’s
own context menu:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1117.png" alt="" />{width=”0.8215277777777777in”
height=”0.8472222222222222in”}The stage’s edit option selects the stage,
so the stage’s scripts and backgrounds are seen in the scripting area.
Note that when the stage is selected, some blocks, especially the Motion
ones, are not in the palette area because the stage can’t move.</p>

<p>The show all option makes all sprites visible, both in the sense of the
show block and by bringing the sprite onstage if it has moved past the
edge of the stage.</p>

<p>The pic… option saves, or opens a browser tab with, a picture of
everything on the stage: its background, lines drawn with the pen, and
any visible sprites. What you see is what you get. (If you want a
picture of just the background, select the stage, open its costumes tab,
control-click/right-click on a background, and export it.)</p>

<p>The pen trails option creates a new costume for the currently selected
sprite consisting of all lines drawn on the stage by the pen of any
sprite. The costume’s rotation center will be the current position of
the sprite.</p>

<p>If you previously turned on the log pen vectors option, and there are
logged vectors, the menu includes an extra option, svg…, that exports
a picture of the stage in vector format. Only lines are logged, not
color regions made with the fill block.</p>

<h2 id="the-sprite-corral-and-sprite-creation-buttons">The Sprite Corral and Sprite Creation Buttons</h2>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1077.png" alt="" />{width=”0.37916666666666665in”

height=”0.16666666666666666in”}Between the stage and the sprite corral
at the bottom right of the Snap<em>!</em> window is a dark grey bar containing
three buttons at the left and one at the right. The first three are used
to create a new sprite. The first button makes a sprite with just the
turtle costume, with a randomly chosen position and pen color. (If you
hold down the Shift key while clicking, the new sprite’s direction will
also be random.) The second button makes a sprite and opens the Paint
Editor so that you can make your own costume for it. (Of course you
could click the first button and then click the paint button in its
costumes tab; this paint button is a shortcut for all that.) Similarly,
the third button uses your camera, if possible, to make a costume for
the new sprite.</p>

<p>The trash can button
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1120.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2916666666666667in”
height=”0.1736111111111111in”} at the right has two uses. You can drag a
sprite thumbnail onto it from the sprite corral to delete that sprite,
or you can click it to undelete a sprite you deleted by accident.</p>

<p>In the sprite corral, you click on a sprite’s “thumbnail” picture to
select that sprite (to make it the one whose scripts, costumes, etc. are
shown in the scripting area). You can drag sprite thumbnails (but not
the stage one) to reorder them; this has no special effect on your
project, but lets you put related ones next to each other, for example.
Double-clicking a thumbnail flashes a halo around the actual sprite on
the stage.</p>

<p>You can right-click/control-click a sprite’s thumbnail to get this
context menu:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1121.png" alt="" />{width=”0.6770833333333334in”
height=”1.1090277777777777in”}The show option makes the sprite visible,
if it was hidden, and also brings it onto the stage, if it had moved
past the stage boundary. The next three options are the same as in the
context menu of the actual sprite on the stage, discussed above.</p>

<p>The parent… option displays a menu of all other sprites, showing which
if any is this sprite’s parent, and allowing you to choose another
sprite (replacing any existing parent). The release option is shown only
if this sprite is a (permanent, or it wouldn’t be in the sprite corral)
clone; it changes the sprite to a temporary clone. (The name is supposed
to mean that the sprite is released from the corral.) The export…
option exports the sprite, like the same option on the stage.</p>

<p>The context menu for the stage thumbnail has only one option, pic…,
which takes a picture of everything on the stage, just like the same
option in the context menu of the stage background. If pen trails are
being logged, there will also be an svg… option.</p>

<p>If your project includes scenes, then under the stage icon in the sprite
corral will be the <em>scene corral:</em></p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1122.png" alt="" />{width=”3.3333333333333335in”
height=”1.7083333333333333in”}Clicking on a scene will select it;
right-clicking will present a menu in which you can rename, delete, or
export the scene.</p>

<h2 id="preloading-a-project-when-starting-snap">Preloading a Project when Starting Snap<em>!</em></h2>

<p>There are several ways to include a pointer to a project in the URL when
starting Snap<em>!</em> in order to load a project automatically. You can think
of such a URL as just running the project rather than as running
Snap<em>!</em>, especially if the URL says to start in presentation mode and
click the green flag. The general form is</p>

<p>http://snap.berkeley.edu/run#<strong><em>verb</em></strong>:<strong><em>project</em></strong>&amp;<strong><em>flag</em></strong>&amp;<strong><em>flag</em></strong>…</p>

<p>The “verb” above can be any of open, run, cloud, present, or dl. The
last three are for shared projects in the Snap<em>!</em> cloud; the first two
are for projects that have been exported and made available anywhere on
the Internet.</p>

<p>Here’s an example that loads a project stored at the Snap<em>!</em> web site
(not the Snap<em>!</em> cloud!):</p>

<p>http://snap.berkeley.edu/run#open:http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/Examples/vee.xml</p>

<p>The project file will be opened, and Snap<em>!</em> will start in edit mode
(with the program visible). Using #run: instead of #open: will start
in presentation mode (with only the stage visible) and will “start” the
project by clicking the green flag. (“Start” is in quotation marks
because there is no guarantee that the project includes any scripts
triggered by the green flag. Some projects are started by typing on the
keyboard or by clicking a sprite.)</p>

<p>If the verb is run, then you can also use any subset of the following
flags:</p>

<p>&amp;editMode Start in edit mode, not presentation mode.</p>

<p>&amp;noRun Don’t click the green flag.</p>

<p>&amp;hideControls Don’t show the row of buttons above the stage (edit mode,
green flag, pause, stop).</p>

<p>&amp;lang=fr Set language to (in this example) French.</p>

<p>&amp;noCloud Don’t allow cloud operations from this project (for running
projects from unknown</p>

<p>sources that include JavaScript code)</p>

<p>&amp;noExitWarning When closing the window or loading a different URL, don’t
show the browser</p>

<p>“are you sure you want to leave this page” message.</p>

<p>&amp;blocksZoom=n Like the Zoom blocks option in the Settings menu.</p>

<p>The last of these flags is intended for use on a web page in which a
Snap<em>!</em> window is embedded.</p>

<p>Here’s an example that loads a shared (public) project from the Snap<em>!</em>
cloud:</p>

<p>http://snap.berkeley.edu/run#present:Username=jens&amp;ProjectName=tree%20animation</p>

<p>(Note that “Username” and “ProjectName” are TitleCased, even though the
flags such as “noRun” are camelCased. Note also that a space in the
project name must be represented in Unicode as %20.) The verb present
behaves like run: it ordinarily starts the project in presentation mode,
but its behavior can be modified with the same four flags as for run.
The verb cloud (yes, we know it’s not a verb in its ordinary use)
behaves like open except that it loads from the Snap<em>!</em> cloud rather
than from the Internet in general. The verb dl (short for “download”)
does not start Snap<em>!</em> but just downloads a cloud-saved project to your
computer as an .xml file. This is useful for debugging; sometimes a
defective project that Snap<em>!</em> won’t run can be downloaded, edited, and
then re-saved to the cloud.</p>

<h2 id="mirror-sites">Mirror Sites</h2>

<p>If the site snap.berkeley.edu is ever unavailable, you can load Snap<em>!</em>
at the following mirror sites:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1123.png" alt="" />{width=”5.8in”
height=”2.1791666666666667in”}The Colors and Crayons library provides
several tools for manipulating color. Although its main purpose is
controlling a sprite’s pen color, it also establishes colors as a first
class data type:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1129.png" alt="" />{width=”3.1333333333333333in”
height=”0.5166666666666667in”}For people who just want colors in their
projects without having to be color experts, we provide two simple
mechanisms: a <em>color number</em> scale with a broad range of continuous
color variation and a set of 100 <em>crayons</em> organized by color family
(ten reds, ten oranges, etc.) The crayons include the block colors:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1130.png" alt="" />{width=”7.166666666666667in”
height=”1.1in”}For experts, we provide color selection by RGB, HSL, HSV,
X11/W3C names, and variants on those scales.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-color">Introduction to Color</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1131.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2361111111111111in”
height=”0.2361111111111111in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1132.png" alt="" />{width=”0.4444444444444444in”

height=”0.2361111111111111in”}Your computer monitor can display millions
of colors, but you probably can’t distinguish that many. For example,
here’s red 57, green 180, blue 200: And here’s red 57, green <em>182,</em> blue
200: You might be able to tell them apart if you see them side by side:
… but maybe not even then.</p>

<p>Color space—the collection of all possible colors—is
three-dimensional, but there are many ways to choose the dimensions. RGB
(red-green-blue), the one most commonly used in computers, matches the
way TVs and displays produce color. Behind every dot on the screen are
three tiny lights: a red one, a green one, and a blue one. But if you
want to print colors on paper, your printer probably uses a different
set of three colors: CMY (cyan-magenta-yellow). You may have seen the
abbreviation CMYK, which represents the common technique of adding black
ink to the collection. (Mixing cyan, magenta, and yellow in equal
amounts is supposed to result in black ink, but typically it comes out a
muddy brown instead, because chemistry.) Other systems that try to mimic
human perception are HSL (hue-saturation-lightness) and HSV
(hue-saturation-value). There are many, many more, each designed for a
particular purpose.</p>

<p>If you are a color professional—a printer, a web designer, a graphic
designer, an artist—then you need to understand all this. It can also
be interesting to learn about. For example, there are colors that you
can see but your computer display can’t generate. If that intrigues you,
look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory">color theory</a> in
Wikipedia.</p>

<h3 id="crayons-and-color-numbers">Crayons and Color Numbers</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1135.png" alt="" />{width=”5.995833333333334in”
height=”0.825in”}But if you just want some colors in your project, we
provide a simple, one-dimensional subset of the available colors. Two
subsets, actually: <em>crayons</em> and <em>color numbers.</em> Here’s the difference:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1138.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2361111111111111in”
height=”0.2361111111111111in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1139.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2361111111111111in”
height=”0.2361111111111111in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1140.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2361111111111111in”
height=”0.2361111111111111in”}The first row shows 100 distinct colors.
They have names; this is pumpkin, and this is denim. You’re supposed to
think of them as a big box of 100 crayons. They’re arranged in families:
grays, pinks, reds, browns, oranges, etc. But they’re not consistently
ordered within a family; you’d be unlikely to say “next crayon” in a
project. (But look at the crayon spiral on page 145.) Instead, you’d
think “I want this to look like a really old-fashioned photo” and so
you’d find sepia as crayon number 33. You don’t have to memorize the
numbers! You can find them in a menu with a submenu for each family.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1141.png" alt="" />{width=”2.1597222222222223in”
height=”0.2569444444444444in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1142.png" alt="" />{width=”7.55in”
height=”2.1527777777777777in”}Or, if you know the crayon name, just .</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1148.png" alt="" />{width=”5.793055555555555in”
height=”0.3in”}The crayon numbers are chosen so that skipping by 10
gives a sensible box of ten crayons:</p>

<p>Alternatively, skipping by 5 gives a still-sensible set of twenty
crayons:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1149.png" alt="" />{width=”5.8in” height=”0.3in”}</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1150.png" alt="" />{width=”6.245138888888889in”
height=”0.25625in”}The set of <em>color numbers</em> is arranged so that each
color number is visually near each of its neighbors. Bright and dark
colors alternate for each family. Color numbers range from 0 to 99, like
crayon numbers, but you can use fractional numbers to get as tiny a step
as you like:</p>

<p>(“As tiny as you like” isn’t <em>quite</em> true because in the end, your color
has to be rounded to integer RGB values for display.)</p>

<p>Both of these scales include the range of shades of gray, from black to
white. Since black is the initial pen color, and black isn’t a hue,
Scratch and Snap<em>!</em> users would traditionally try to use set color to
escape from black, and it wouldn’t work. By including black in the same
scale as other colors, we eliminate the Black Hole problem if people use
only the recommended color scales.</p>

<p>We are making a point of saying “color number” for what was sometimes
called just “color” in earlier versions of the library, because we now
reserve the name “color” for an actual color, an instance of the color
data type.<br />
<strong>How to Use the Library</strong></p>

<p>There are three library blocks specifically about controlling the pen.
They have the same names as three of the primitive Pen blocks:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image401.png" alt="" />{width=”6.066666666666666in”
height=”0.30833333333333335in”}</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1156.png" alt="" />{width=”7.4875in”
height=”1.1in”}The first (Pen block-colored) input slot is used to
select which color scale you want to use. (These blocks also allow
reading or setting two block properties that are not colors: the pen
size and its transparency.) The pen reporter requires no other inputs;
it reports the state of the pen in whatever dimension you choose.</p>

<p>As the last example shows, you can’t ask for the pen color in a scale
incompatible with how you set it, unless the block can deduce what you
want from what it knows about the current pen color.</p>

<p>The change pen block applies only to numeric scales (including vectors
of three or four numbers). It adds its numeric or list input to the
current pen value(s), doing vector (item-by-item) addition for vector
scales.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1162.png" alt="" />{width=”7.491666666666666in”
height=”1.1069444444444445in”}The set pen block changes the pen color to
the value(s) you specify. The meaning of the white input slots depends
on which attribute of the pen you’re setting:</p>

<p>In the last example, the number 37 sets the <em>transparency,</em> on the scale
0=opaque, 100=invisible. (All color attributes are on a 0–100 scale
except for RGB components, which are 0–255.) A transparency value can
be combined with any of these attribute scales.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image414.png" alt="" />{width=”5.383333333333334in”
height=”0.23333333333333334in”}The library also includes two
constructors and a selector for colors as a data type:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image402.png" alt="" />{width=”1.8055555555555556in”
height=”0.19444444444444445in”}The latter two are inverses of each
other, translating between colors and their attributes. The color from
block’s attribute menu has fewer choices than the similar set pen block
because you can, for example, set the Red value of the existing pen
color leaving the rest unchanged, but when creating a color out of
nothing you have to provide its entire specification, e.g., all of Red,
Green, and Blue, or the equivalent in other scales. (As you’ll see on
the next page, we provide two <em>linear</em> (one-dimensional) color scales
that allow you to specify a color with a single number, at the cost of
including only a small subset of the millions of colors your computer
can generate.) If you have a color and want another color that’s the
same except for one number, as in the Red example, you can use this
block:</p>

<p>Finally, the library includes the mix block and a helper:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1181.png" alt="" />{width=”6.113194444444445in”
height=”0.23333333333333334in”}We’ll have more to say about these after
a detour through color theory.</p>

<p>That’s all you have to know about colors! <em>Crayons</em> for specific
interesting ones, <em>color numbers</em> for gradual transformation from one
color to the next. But there’s a bit more to say, if you’re interested.
If not, stop here. (But look at the samples of the different scales on
page 145.)<br />
<strong>More about Colors: Fair Hues and Shades</strong></p>

<p>Several of the three-dimensional arrangements of colors use the concept
of “hue,” which more or less means where a color would appear in a
rainbow (magenta, near the right, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magenta">a long
story</a>):</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1183.png" alt="" />{width=”5.806666666666667in”
height=”0.30666666666666664in”}</p>

<p>These are called “spectral” colors, after the <em>spectrum</em> of rainbow
colors. But these colors aren’t equally distributed. There’s an awful
lot of green, hardly any yellow, and just a sliver of orange. And no
brown at all.</p>

<p>And this is already a handwave, because the range of colors that can be
generated by RGB monitors doesn’t include some of the <em>true</em> spectral
colors. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color">Spectral
color</a> in Wikipedia for
all the gory details.</p>

<p>This isn’t a problem with the physics of rainbows. It’s in the human eye
and the human brain that certain ranges of wavelength of light waves are
lumped together as named colors. The eye is just “tuned” to recognize a
wide range of colors as green. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rods_and_cones">Rods and
Cones</a>.) And
different human cultures give names to different color ranges.
Nevertheless, in old Scratch projects, you’d say change pen color by 1
and it’d take forever to reach a color that wasn’t green.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1184.png" alt="" />{width=”5.9944444444444445in”
height=”0.29930555555555555in”}For color professionals, there are good
reasons to want to work with the physical rainbow hue layout. But for
amateurs using a simplified, one-dimensional color model, there’s no
reason not to use a more programmer-friendly hue scale:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1185.png" alt="" />{width=”1.4597222222222221in”
height=”1.3583333333333334in”}In this scale, each of the seven rainbow
colors and brown get an equal share. (Red’s looks too small, but that’s
because it’s split between the two ends: hue 0 is pure red, brownish
reds are to its right, and purplish reds are wrapped around to the right
end.) We call this scale “fair hue” because each color family gets a
fair share of the total hue range. (By the way, you were probably taught
“… green, blue, indigo, violet” in school, but it turns out that color
names were different in Isaac Newton’s day, and the color he called
“blue” is more like modern cyan, while his “indigo” is more like modern
blue. See Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo">Indigo</a>.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1186.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2361111111111111in”
height=”0.2361111111111111in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1187.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2361111111111111in”
height=”0.2361111111111111in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1188.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2361111111111111in”
height=”0.2361111111111111in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1189.png" alt="" />{width=”0.2361111111111111in”
height=”0.2361111111111111in”}Our <em>color number</em> scale is based on fair
hues, adding a range of grays from black (color number 0) to white
(color number14) and also adding <em>shades</em> of the spectral colors. (In
color terminology, a <em>shade</em> is a darker version of a color; a lighter
version is called a <em>tint.</em>) Why do we add shades but not tints? Partly
because I find shades more exciting. A shade of red can be dark candy
apple red or maroon , but a tint is just some kind of pink . This
admitted prejudice is supported by an objective fact: Most projects are
made on a white background, so dark colors stand out better than light
ones.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1190.png" alt="" />{width=”5.999305555555556in”
height=”1.507638888888889in”}So, in our color number scale, color
numbers 0 to 14 are kinds of gray; the remaining color numbers go
through the fair hues, but alternating full-strength colors with shades.</p>

<p>This chart shows how the color scales discussed so far are related. Note
that all scales range from 0 to 100; the fair hues scale has been
compressed in the chart so that similar colors line up vertically. (Its
dimensions are different because it doesn’t include the grays at the
left. Since there are eight color families, the pure, named fair hues
are at multiples of 100/8=12.5, starting with red=0.)</p>

height=”1.0798611111111112in”}White is crayon 14 and color number 14.
This value was deliberately chosen <em>not</em> to be a multiple of 5 so that
the every-fifth-crayon and every-tenth-crayon selections don’t include
it, so that all of the crayons in those smaller boxes are visible
against a white stage background.</p>

<p>Among purples, the official spectral violet (crayon 90) is the end of
the spectrum. Magenta, brighter than violet, isn’t a spectral color at
all. (In the picture at the left, the top part is the spectrum of white
light spread out through a prism; the middle part is a photograph of a
rainbow, and the bottom part is a digital simulation of a rainbow.)
Magenta is a mixture of red and blue. (attribution: Wikipedia user

<p>The light gray at color number 10 is slightly different from crayon 10
just because of roundoff in computing crayon values. Color number 90 is
different from crayon 90 because the official RGB violet (equal parts
red and blue) is actually lighter than spectral violet. The purple
family is also unusual because magenta, crayon and color number 95, is
lighter than the violet at 90. In other families, the color numbers,
crayons, and (scaled) fair hues all agree at multiples of ten. These
multiple-of-ten positions are the standard RGB primary and secondary
colors, e.g., the yellow at color number 50 is (255, 255, 0) in RGB.
(Gray, brown, and orange don’t have such simple RGB settings.)</p>

<p>The color numbers at odd multiples of five are generally darker shades
than the corresponding crayons. The latter are often official named
shades, e.g., teal, crayon 65, is a half-intensity shade of cyan. The
odd-five <em>color numbers,</em> though, are often darker, since they are
chosen to be the darkest color in a given family that’s visibly
different from black. The pink at color number 15, though, is quite
different from crayon 15, because the former is a pure tint of red,
whereas the crayon, to get a more interesting pink, has a little magenta
mixed in. Color numbers at multiples of five are looked up in a table;
other color values are determined by linear interpolation in RGB space.
(<em>Crayons</em> are of course all found by table lookup.)</p>

<p>The from color block behaves specially when you ask for the <em>color
number</em> of a color. Most colors don’t exactly match a color number, and
for other attributes of a color (crayon number, X11 name) you don’t get
an answer unless the color exactly matches one of the names or numbers
in that attribute. But for color number, the block tries to find the
<em>nearest color number</em> to the color you specify. The result will be only
approximate; you can’t use the number you get to recreate the input
color. But you can start choosing nearby color numbers as you animate
the sprite.</p>

<h3 id="perceptual-spaces-hsv-and-hsl">Perceptual Spaces: HSV and HSL</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1193.png" alt="" />{width=”0.7361111111111112in”
height=”0.7222222222222222in”}RGB is the right way to think about colors
if you’re building or programming a display monitor; CMYK is the right
way if you’re building or programming a color printer. But neither of
those coordinate systems is very intuitive if you’re trying to
understand what color <em>you see</em> if, for example, you mix 37% red light,
52% green, and 11% blue. The <em>hue</em> scale is one dimension of most
attempts at a perceptual scale. The square at the right has pale blues
along the top edge, dark blues along the right edge, various shades of
gray toward the left, black at the bottom, and pure spectral blue in the
top right corner. Although no other point in the square is pure blue,
you can tell at a glance that no other spectral color is mixed with the
blue.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1194.png" alt="" />{width=”2.691666666666667in”
height=”1.1902777777777778in”}Aside from hue, the other two dimensions
of a color space have to represent how much white and/or black is mixed
with the spectral color. (Bear in mind that “mixing black” is a metaphor
when it comes to monitors. There really is black paint, but there’s no
such thing as black light.) One such space, HSV, has one dimension for
the amount of color (vs. white), called <em>saturation,</em> and one for the
amount of black, imaginatively called <em>value.</em> HSV stands for
Hue-Saturation-Value. (Value is also called <em>brightness.</em>) The <em>value</em>
is actually measured backward from the above description; that is, if
value is 0, the color is pure black; if value is 100, then a saturation
of 0 means all white, no spectral color; a saturation of 100 means no
white at all. In the square in the previous paragraph, the <em>x</em> axis is
the saturation and the <em>y</em> axis is the value. The entire bottom edge is
black, but only the top left corner is white. HSV is the traditional
color space used in Scratch and Snap<em>!.</em> Set pen color set the hue; set
pen shade set the value. There was originally no Pen block to set the
saturation, but there’s a set brightness effect Looks block to control
the saturation of the sprite’s costume. (I speculate that the Scratch
designers, like me, thought tints were less vivid than shades against a
white background, so they made it harder to control tinting.)</p>

height=”0.7638888888888888in”}But if you’re looking at colors on a
computer display, HSV isn’t really a good match for human perception.
Intuitively, black and white should be treated symmetrically. This is
the HSL (hue-saturation-lightness) color space. <em>Saturation,</em> in HSL, is
a measure of the <em>grayness</em> or <em>dullness</em> of a color (how close it comes
to being on a black-and-white scale) and <em>lightness</em> measures
<em>spectralness</em> with pure white at one end, pure black at the other end,
and spectral color in the middle. The <em>saturation</em> number is actually
the opposite of grayness: 0 means pure gray, and 100 means pure spectral
color, provided that the <em>lightness</em> is 50, midway between black and
white. Colors with lightness other than 50 have some black or white
mixed in, but saturation 100 means that the color is as fully saturated
as it can be, given the amount of white or black needed to achieve that
lightness. Saturation less than 100 means that <em>both white and black</em>
are mixed with the spectral color. (Such mixtures are called <em>tones</em> of
the spectral color. Perceptually, colors with saturation 100% don’t look
gray: but colors with saturation 75% do:</p>

<p>Note that HSV and HSL both have a dimension called “saturation,” but
<em>they’re not the same thing!</em> In HSV, “saturation” means non-whiteness,
whereas in HSL it means non-grayness (vividness).</p>

<p>More fine print: It’s misleading to talk about the spectrum of light
wavelengths as if it were the same as perceived hue. If your computer
display is showing you a yellow area, for example, it’s doing it by
turning on its red and green LEDs over that area, and what hits your
retina <em>is still two wavelengths of light, red and green, superimposed.</em>
You could make what’s perceptually the same yellow by using a single
intermediate wavelength. Your eye and brain don’t distinguish between
those two kinds of yellow. Also, your brain automatically adjusts
perceived hue to correct for differences in illumination. When you place
a monochrome object so that it’s half in sunlight and half in the shade,
you see it as one even though what’s reaching your eyes from the two
regions differs a lot. And, sadly, it’s HSL whose use of “saturation”
disagrees with the official international color vocabulary
standardization committee. I learned all this from <a href="http://www.huevaluechroma.com/011.php">this
tutorial</a>, which you might find
more coherent than jumping around Wikipedia if you’re interested.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1198.png" alt="" />{width=”1.64375in”
height=”0.8416666666666667in”}Although traditional Scratch and Snap<em>!</em>
use HSV in programs, they use HSL in the color picker. The horizontal
axis is hue (fair hue, in this version) and the vertical axis is
<em>lightness,</em> the scale with black at one end and white at the other end.
It would make no sense to have only the bottom half of this selector
(HSV Value) or only the top half (HSV Saturation). And, given that you
can only fit two dimensions on a flat screen, it makes sense to pick HSL
saturation (vividness) as the one to keep at 100%. (In this fair-hue
picker, some colors appear twice: “spectral” (50% lightness) browns as
shades (≈33% lightness) of red or orange, and shades of those browns.)</p>

height=”0.18888888888888888in”}Software that isn’t primarily about
colors (so, <em>not</em> including Photoshop, for example) typically use HSV or
HSL, with web-based software more likely to use HSV because that’s
what’s built into the JavaScript programming language provided by
browsers. But if the goal is to model human color perception, neither of
these color spaces is satisfactory, because they assume that all
full-intensity spectral colors are equally bright. But if you’re like
most people, you see spectral yellow as much brighter than spectral blue
. There are better perceptual color spaces with names like L*u*v* and
L*a*b* that are based on research with human subjects to determine
true perceived brightness. Wikipedia explains all this and more at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSL
and HSV</a>, where they
recommend ditching both of these simplistic color spaces.</p>

<h3 id="mixing-colors">Mixing Colors</h3>

<p>Given first class colors, the next question is, what operations apply to
them, the way arithmetic operators apply to numbers and higher order
functions apply to lists? The equivalent to adding numbers is mixing
colors, but unfortunately there isn’t a simple answer to what that
means.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1201.png" alt="" />{width=”4.347222222222222in”
height=”0.5625in”}The easiest kind of color mixing to understand is
<em>additive</em> mixing, which is what happens when you shine two colored
lights onto a (white) wall. It’s also what happens in your computer
screen, where each dot (pixel) of an image is created by a tiny red
light, a tiny green light, and a tiny blue light that can be combined at
different strengths to make different colors. Essentially, additive
mixing of two colors is computed by adding the two red components, the
two green components, and the two blue components. It’s not <em>quite</em> that
simple only because each component of the result must be in the range 0
to 255. So, red (255, 0, 0) mixed with green (0, 255, 0) gives (255,
255, 0), which is yellow. But red (255, 0, 0) plus yellow (255, 255, 0)
can’t give (510, 255, 0). Just limiting the red in the result to 255
would mean that red plus yellow is yellow, which doesn’t make sense.
Instead, if the red value has to be reduced by half (from 510 to 255),
then <em>all three</em> values must be reduced by half, so the result is (255,
128, 0), which is orange. (Half of 255 is 127.5, but each RGB value must
be an integer.)</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1205.png" alt="" />{width=”4.492361111111111in”
height=”0.55in”}A different kind of color mixing based on light is done
when different colored transparent plastic sheets are held in front of a
white light, as is done in theatrical lighting. In that situation, the
light that gets through both filters is what remains after some light is
filtered out by the first one and some of what’s left is filtered out by
the second one. In red-green-blue terms, a red filter filters out green
and blue; a yellow filter allows red and green through, filtering out
blue. But there isn’t any green light for the yellow filter to pass; it
was filtered out by the red filter. Each filter can only remove light,
not add light, so this is called <em>subtractive</em> mixing:</p>

<p>Perhaps confusingly, the numerical computation of subtractive mixing is
done by <em>multiplying</em> the RGB values, taken as fractions of the maximum
255, so red (1, 0, 0) times yellow (1, 1, 0) is red again.</p>

<p>Those are both straightforward to compute. Much, much more complicated
is trying to simulate the result of mixing <em>paints.</em> It’s not just that
we’d have to compute a more complicated function of the red, green, and
blue values; it’s that RGB values (or any other three-dimensional color
space) are inadequate to describe the behavior of paints. Two paints can
look identical, and have the same RGB values, but may still behave very
differently when mixed with other colors. The differences are mostly due
to the chemistry of the paints, but are also affected by exactly how the
colors are mixed. The mixing is mostly subtractive; red paint <em>absorbs</em>
most of the colors other than red, so what’s reflected off the surface
is whatever isn’t absorbed by the colors being mixed. But there can be
an additive component also.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1209.gif" alt="" />{width=”7.5in”
height=”0.875in”}The proper mathematical abstraction to describe a paint
is a <em>reflectance</em> graph, like this:</p>

<p>(These aren’t paints, but minerals, and one software-generated spectrum,
from the US Geological Survey’s <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/labs/spec-lab/capabilities/spectral-library">Spectral
Library</a>.
The details don’t matter, just the fact that a graph like these gives
much more information than three RGB numbers.) To mix two paints
properly, you multiply the <em>y</em> values (as fractions) at each matching
<em>x</em> coordinate of the two graphs.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1221.png" alt="" />{width=”4.627777777777778in”
height=”0.5763888888888888in”} Having said all that, the mix block takes
the colors it is given as inputs and converts them into what we hope are
<em>typical</em> paint reflectance spectra that would look like those colors,
and then mixes those spectra and converts back to RGB.</p>

<p>But unlike the other two kinds of mixing, in this case we can’t say that
these colors are “the right answer”; what would happen with real paints
depends on their chemical composition and how they’re mixed. There are
three more mixing options, but these three are the ones that correspond
to real-world color mixing.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1225.png" alt="" />{width=”4.340277777777778in”
height=”0.6527777777777778in”}The mix block will accept any number of
colors, and will mix them in equal proportion. If (for any kind of
mixing) you want more of one color than another, use the color at weight
block to make a “weighted color”:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1226.png" alt="" />{width=”5.166666666666667in”
height=”0.4305555555555556in”}This mixes four parts red paint to one
part green paint. All colors in a mixture can be weighted:</p>

interesting colors, <em>[color numbers]{.underline}</em> for a continuum of
high-contrast colors with a range of hues and shading, and <em>[fair

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1248.png" alt="" />{width=”6.2375in”
height=”2.5in”}The left graph shows that, unsurprisingly, all of the
brown fair hues make essentially no progress in real hue, with the
orange-brown section actually a little retrograde, since browns are
really shades of orange and so the real hues overlap between fair browns
and fair oranges. Green makes up some of the distance, because there are
too many green real hues and part of the goal of the fair hue scale is
to squeeze that part of the hue spectrum. But much of the catching up
happens very quickly, between pure magenta at fair hue 93.75 and the
start of the purple-red section at fair hue 97. This abrupt change is
unfortunate, but the alternatives involve either stealing space from red
or stealing space from purple (which already has to include both
spectral violet and RGB magenta). The graph has discontinuous derivative
at the table-lookup points, of which there are two in each color family,
one at the pure-named-RGB colors at multiples of 12.5, and the other
<em>roughly</em> halfway to the next color family, except for the purple
family, which has lookup points at 87.5 (approximate spectral violet),
93.75 (RGB magenta), and 97 (turning point toward the red family). (In
the color picker, blue captures cyan and purple space in dark shades.
This, too, is an artifact of human vision.)</p>

<p>The right graph shows the HSV saturation and value for all the fair
hues. Saturation is at 100%, as it should be in a hue scale, except for
a very slight drop in part of the browns. (Browns are shades of orange,
not tints, so one would expect full saturation, except that some of the
browns are actually mixtures with related hues.) But value, also as
expected, falls substantially in the browns, to a low of about 56%
(halfway to black) for the “pure” brown at 45° (fair hue 12.5). But the
curve is smooth, without inflection points other than that minimum-value
pure brown.</p>

<p>“Fair saturation” and “fair value” are by definition 100% for the entire
range of fair hues. This means that in the browns, the real saturation
and value are the product (in percent) of the innate shading of the
specific brown fair hue and the user’s fair saturation/value setting.
When the user’s previous color setting was in a real scale and the new
setting is in a fair scale, the program assumes that the previous
saturation and value were entirely user-determined; when the previous
color setting was in a brown fair hue and the new setting is also in a
fair scale, the program remembers the user’s intention from the previous
setting. (Internal calculations are based on HSV, even though we
recommend HSL to users, because HSV comes to us directly from the
JavaScript color management implementation.) This is why the set pen
block includes options for “fair saturation” and so on.</p>

height=”2.2916666666666665in”}Here is a picture of integer color
numbers, but remember that color numbers are continuous. (As usual,
“continuous” values are ultimately converted to integer RGB values, so
there’s really some granularity.) Color numbers 0-14 are continuously
varying grayscale, from 0=black to 14=white. Color numbers 14+ε to 20
are linearly varying shades of pink, with RGB Red at color number 20.</p>

<p>Beyond that point, in each color family, the multiple of ten color
number in the middle is the RGB standard color of that family, in which
each component is either 255 or 0. (Exceptions are brown, which is of
course darker than any of those colors; orange, with its green component
half-strength: [255, 127, 0]; and violet, discussed below.) The
following multiple of five is the number of the darkest color in that
family, although not necessarily the same hue as the multiple of ten
color number. Color numbers between the multiple of ten and the
following multiple of five are shades of colors entirely within the
family. Color numbers in the four <em>before</em> the multiple of ten are
mixtures of this family and the one before it. So, for example, in the
green family, we have</p>

<p>55 Darkest yellow.</p>

<p>(55, 60) shades of yellow-green mixtures. As the color number increases,
both the hue and the lightness (or value, depending on your religion)
increase, so we get brighter and greener colors.</p>

<p>60 Canonical green, [0, 255, 0], whose W3C color name is “lime,” not
“green.”</p>

<p>(60, 65) Shades of green. No cyan mixed in.</p>

<p>65 Darkest green.</p>

<p>(65,70) Shades of green-cyan mixtures.</p>

<p>In the color number chart, all the dark color numbers look a lot like
black, but they’re quite different. Here are the darkest colors in each
color number family.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1255.png" alt="" />{width=”1.3888888888888888in”
height=”1.3888888888888888in”}Darkest yellow doesn’t look entirely
yellow. You might see it as greenish or brownish. As it turns out, the
darkest color that really looks yellow is hardly dark at all. This color
was hand-tweaked to look neither green nor brown to me, but ymmv.</p>

<p>In some families, the center+5 <em>crayon</em> is an important named darker
version of the center color: In the red family, [128, 0, 0] is
“maroon.” In the cyan family, [0, 128, 128] is “teal.” An early
version of the color number scale used these named shades as the
center+5 color number also. But on this page we use the word “darkest”
advisedly: You can’t find a darker shade of this family anywhere in the
color number scale, but you <em>can</em> find lighter shades. Teal is color
number 73.1, ($70 + 5 \bullet \frac{255 - 128}{255 - 50}$), because
darkest cyan, color 75, is [0, 50, 50]. The color number for maroon is
left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>The purple family is different from the others, because it has to
include both spectral violet and extraspectral RGB magenta. Violet is
usually given as RGB [128, 0, 255], but that’s much brighter than the
violet in an actual spectrum (see page 142). We use [80, 0, 90], a
value hand-tweaked to look as much as possible like the violet in
rainbow photos, as color number 90. (<em>Crayon</em> 90 is [128, 0, 255].)
Magenta, [255, 0, 255], is color number 95. This means that the colors
get <em>brighter,</em> not darker, between 90 and 95. The darkest violet is
actually color number 87.5, so it’s bluer than standard violet, but
still plainly a purple and not a blue. It’s [39,0,76]. It’s <em>not</em>
hand-tweaked; it’s a linear interpolation between darkest blue, [0, 0,
64], and the violet at color number 90. I determined by experiment that
color number 87.5 is the darkest one that’s still unambiguously purple.
(According to Wikipedia, “violet” names only the spectral color, while
“purple” is the name of the whole color family.)</p>

<p>The book <em>A Programming Language</em> was published by mathematician Kenneth
E. Iverson in 1962. He wanted a formal language that would look like
what mathematicians write on chalkboards. The then-unnamed language
would later take its name from the first letters of the words in the
book’s title. It was little-known until 1964, when a formal description
of the just-announced IBM System/360 in the <em>IBM Systems Journal</em> used
APL notation. (Around the same time, Iverson’s associate Adin Falkoff
gave a talk on APL to a New York Association for Computing Machinery
chapter, with an excited 14-year-old Brian Harvey in the audience.) But
it wasn’t until 1966 that the first public implementation of the
language for the System/360 was published by IBM. (It was called
“APL\360” because the normal slash character / represents the “reduce”
operator in APL, while backslash is “expand.”)</p>

<p>The crucial idea behind APL is that mathematicians think about
collections of numbers, one-dimensional <em>vectors</em> and two-dimensional
<em>matrices,</em> as valid objects in themselves, what computer scientists
later learned to call “first class data.” A mathematician who wants to
add two vectors writes <strong><em>v</em>~1~</strong> + <strong><em>v</em>~2~</strong>, not “for i = 1 to
length(v1), result[i]=v1[i]+v2[i].” Same for a programmer using
APL.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of function in APL: scalar functions, mixed
functions, and operators. A <em>scalar function</em> is one whose natural
domain is individual numbers or text characters. A <em>mixed function</em> is
one whose domain includes arrays (vectors, matrices, or
higher-dimensional collections). In Snap<em>!</em>, scalar functions are
generally found in the green Operators palette, while mixed functions
are in the red Lists palette. The third category, confusingly for
Snap<em>!</em> users, is called <em>operators</em> in APL, but corresponds to what we
call higher order functions: functions whose domain includes functions.</p>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> hyperblocks are scalar functions that behave like APL scalar
functions: they can be called with arrays as inputs, and the underlying
function is applied to each number in the arrays. (If the function is
<em>monadic,</em> meaning that it takes one input, then there’s no complexity
to this idea. Take the square root of an array, and you are taking the
square root of each number in the array. If the function is <em>dyadic,</em>
taking two inputs, then the two arrays must have the same shape. Snap<em>!</em>
is more forgiving than APL; if the arrays don’t agree in number of
dimensions, called the <em>rank</em> of the array, the lower-rank array is
matched repeatedly with subsets of the higher-rank one; if they don’t
agree in length along one dimension, the result has the shorter length
and some of the numbers in the longer-length array are ignored. An
exception in both languages is that if one of the two inputs is a
scalar, then it is matched with every number in the other array input.)</p>

<p>As explained in Section I.G, this termwise extension of scalar functions
is the main APL-like feature built into Snap<em>!</em> itself. We also include
an extension of the item block to address multiple dimensions, an
extension to the length block with five list functions from APL, and a
new primitive reshape block. The APL library extends the implementation
of APL features to include a few missing scalar functions and several
missing mixed functions and operators.</p>

<p>Programming in APL really is <em>very</em> different in style from programming
in other languages, even Snap<em>!</em>. This appendix can’t hope to be a
complete reference for APL, let alone a tutorial. If you’re interested,
find one of those in a library or a (probably used) bookstore, read it,
and <em>do the exercises.</em> Sorry to sound like a teacher, but the notation
is sufficiently weird as to take a lot of practice before you start to
think in APL.</p>

<p>A note on versions: There is a widely standardized APL2, several
idiosyncratic extensions, and a successor language named J. The latter
uses plain ASCII characters, unlike the ones with APL in their names,
which use the mathematician’s character set, with Greek letters,
typestyles (boldface and/or italics in books; underlined, upper case, or
lower case in APL) as loose type declarations, and symbols not part of
anyone’s alphabet, such as ⌊ for floor and ⌈ for ceiling. To use the
original APL, you needed expensive special computer terminals. (This was
before you could download fonts in software. Today the more unusual APL
characters are in Unicode at U+2336 to U+2395.) The character set was
probably the main reason APL didn’t take over the world. APL2 has a lot
to recommend it for Snap<em>!</em> users, mainly because it moves from the
original APL idea that all arrays must be uniform in dimension, and the
elements of arrays must be numbers or single text characters, to our
idea that a list can be an element of another list, and that such
elements don’t all have to have the same dimensions. Nevertheless, its
mechanism for allowing both old-style APL arrays and more general
“nested arrays” is complicated and hard for an APL beginner (probably
all but two or three Snap<em>!</em> users) to understand. So we are starting
with plain APL. If it turns out to be wildly popular, we may decide
later to include APL2 features.</p>

<p>Here are some of the guiding ideas in the design of the APL library:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1257.png" alt="" />{width=”4.451388888888889in”
height=”0.5208333333333334in”}Goal:  Enable interested <strong>Snap<em>!</em></strong> users
to learn the feel and style of APL programming. It’s really worth the
effort. For example, we didn’t hyperize the = block because Snap<em>!</em>
users expect it to give a single yes-or-no answer about the equality of
two complete structures, whatever their types and shapes. In APL, = is a
scalar function; it compares two numbers or two characters. How could
APL users live without the ability to ask if two <em>structures</em> are equal?
Because in APL you can say <strong>∧</strong>/,a=b to get that answer. Reading from
right to left, a=b reports an array of Booleans (represented in APL as 0
for False, 1 for True); the comma operator turns the shape of the array
into a simple vector; and <strong>∧</strong>/ means “reduce with and”; “reduce” is
our combine function. That six-character program is much less effort
than the equivalent</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1258.png" alt="" />{width=”0.9930555555555556in”
height=”0.20833333333333334in”}in Snap<em>!</em>. Note in passing that if you
wanted to know <em>how many</em> corresponding elements of the two arrays are
equal, you’d just use +/ instead of <strong>∧</strong>/. Note also that our APLish
blocks are a little verbose, because they include up to three notations
for the function: the usual Snap<em>!</em> name (e.g., flatten), the name APL
programmers use when talking about it (ravel), and, in yellow type, the
symbol used in actual APL code (,). We’re not consistent about it; seems
self-documenting. And LCM (and) is different even though it has two
names; it turns out that if you represent Boolean values as 0 and 1,
then the algorithm to compute the least common multiple of two integers
computes the and function if the two inputs happen to be Boolean.
Including the APL symbols serves two purposes: the two or three Snap<em>!</em>
users who’ve actually programmed in APL will be sure what function
they’re using, but more importantly, the ones who are reading an APL
tutorial while building programs in Snap<em>!</em> will find the block that
matches the APL they’re reading.<br />
<br />
Goal:  Bring the best and most general APL ideas into “mainstream”
<strong>Snap<em>!</em></strong> programming style. Media computation, in particular, becomes
much simpler when scalar functions can be applied to an entire picture
or sound. Yes, map provides essentially the same capability, but the
notation gets complicated if you want to map over columns rather than
rows. Also, Snap<em>!</em> lists are fundamentally one-dimensional, but real
data often have more dimensions. A Snap<em>!</em> programmer has to be thinking
all the time about the convention that we represent a matrix as a list
of rows, each of which is a list of individual cells. That is, row 23 of
a spreadsheet is item 23 of spreadsheet, but column 23 is map (item 23
of _) over spreadsheet. APL treats rows and columns more
symmetrically.<br />
<br />
Non-goal:  Allow programs written originally in APL to run in
<strong>Snap<em>!</em></strong> essentially unchanged.  For example, in APL the atomic text
unit is a single character, and strings of characters are lists. We
treat a text string as scalar, and that isn’t going to change. Because
APL programmers rarely use conditionals, instead computing functions
involving arrays of Boolean values to achieve the same effect, the
notation they do have for conditionals is primitive (in the sense of
Paleolithic, not in the sense of built in). We’re not changing ours.<br />
<br />
Non-goal:  Emulate the terse APL syntax. It’s too bad, in a way; as
noted above, the terseness of expressing a computation affects APL
programmers’ sense of what’s difficult and what isn’t. But you can’t say
“terse” and “block language” in the same sentence. Our whole <em>raison
d’être</em> is to make it possible to build a program without having to
memorize the syntax or the names of functions, and to allow those names
to be long enough to be self-documenting. And APL’s syntax has its own
issues, of which the biggest is that it’s hard to use functions with
more than two inputs; because most mathematical dyadic functions use
infix notation (the function symbol between the two inputs), the notion
of “left argument” and “right argument” is universal in APL
documentation. The thing people most complain about, that there is no
operator precedence (like the multiplication-before-addition rule in
normal arithmetic notation), really doesn’t turn out to be a problem.
Function grouping is strictly right to left, so 2×3+4 means two times
seven, not six plus four. That takes some getting used to, but it really
doesn’t take long if you immerse yourself in APL. The reason is that
there are too many infix operators for people to memorize a precedence
table. But in any case, block notation eliminates the problem,
especially with Snap<em>!</em>’s zebra coloring. You can see and control the
grouping by which block is inside which other block’s input slot.
Another problem with APL’s syntax is that it bends over backward not to
have reserved words, as opposed to Fortran, its main competition back
then. So the dyadic <strong>○</strong> “circular functions” function uses the left
argument to select a trig function. 1<strong>○</strong>x is sin(x), 2<strong>○</strong>x is
cos(x), and so on. <strong>‾</strong>1<strong>○</strong>x is arcsin(x). What’s 0<strong>○</strong>x? Glad you
asked; it’s$\ \sqrt{1 - x^{2}}$.</p>

<h3 id="boolean-values">Boolean values</h3>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> uses distinct Boolean values true and false that are different
from other data types. APL uses 1 and 0, respectively. The APL style of
programming depends heavily on doing arithmetic on Booleans, although
their conditionals insist on only 0 or 1 in a Boolean input slot, not
other numbers. Snap<em>!</em> <em>arithmetic</em> functions treat false as 0 and true
as 1, so our APL library tries to report Snap<em>!</em> Boolean values from
predicate functions.</p>

<h3 id="width5733333333333333in-height11066666666666667inscalar-functions"><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1259.png" alt="" />{width=”5.733333333333333in” height=”1.1066666666666667in”}Scalar functions</h3>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1260.png" alt="" />{width=”2.566666666666667in”
height=”0.21666666666666667in”}These are the scalar functions in the APL
library. Most of them are straightforward to figure out. The scalar =
block provides an APL-style version of = (and other exceptions) as a
hyperblock that extends termwise to arrays. Join, the only non-predicate
non-hyper scalar primitive, has its own scalar join block. 7 deal 52
reports a random vector of seven numbers from 1 to 52 with no
repetitions, as in dealing a hand of cards. Signum of a number reports 1
if the number is positive, 0 if it’s zero, or -1 if it’s negative. Roll
6 reports a random roll of a six-sided die. To roll 8 dice, use , which
would look much more pleasant as ?8⍴6. But perhaps our version is more
instantly readable by someone who didn’t grow up with APL. All the
library functions have help messages available.</p>

<h3 id="mixed-functions">Mixed functions</h3>

<p>Mixed functions include lists in their natural domain or range. That is,
one or both of its inputs <em>must</em> be a list, or it always reports a list.
Sometimes both inputs are naturally lists; sometimes one input of a
dyadic mixed function is naturally a scalar, and the function treats a
list in that input slot as an implicit map, as for scalar functions.
This means you have to learn the rule for each mixed function
individually.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1261.png" alt="" />{width=”4.275in”

height=”0.18333333333333332in”}The shape of function takes any input and
reports a vector of the maximum size of the structure along each
dimension. For a vector, it returns a list of length 1 containing the
length of the input. For a matrix, it returns a two-item list of the
number of rows and number of columns of the input. And so on for higher
dimensions. If the input isn’t a list at all, then it has zero
dimensions, and shape of reports an empty vector.</p>

<p>Equivalent to the dimensions of primitive, as of 6.6.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1263.png" alt="" />{width=”1.0416666666666667in”
height=”0.18333333333333332in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1264.png" alt="" />{width=”2.033333333333333in”
height=”0.18333333333333332in”}Rank of isn’t an actual APL primitive,
but the composition ⍴⍴ (shape of shape of a structure), which reports
the number of dimensions of the structure (the length of its shape
vector), is too useful to omit. (It’s very easy to type the same
character twice on the APL keyboard, but less easy to drag blocks
together.) Equivalent to the rank of primitive, as of 6.6.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1265.png" alt="" />{width=”7.325in”
height=”0.8333333333333334in”}Reshape takes a shape vector (such as
shape might report) on the left and any structure on the right. It
ignores the shape of the right input, stringing the atomic elements into
a vector in row-major order (that is, all of the first row left to
right, then all of the second row, etc.). (The primitive reshape takes
the inputs in the other order.) It then reports an array with the shape
specified by the first input containing the items of the second:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1266.png" alt="" />{width=”6.575in”
height=”1.0416666666666667in”}If the right input has more atomic
elements than are required by the left-input shape vector, the excess
are ignored without reporting an error. If the right input has too <em>few</em>
atomic elements, the process of filling the reported array starts again
from the first element. This is most useful in the specific case of an
atomic right input, which produces an array of any desired shape all of
whose atomic elements are equal. But other cases are sometimes useful
too:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1267.png" alt="" />{width=”5.508333333333334in”

height=”0.18333333333333332in”}Flatten takes an arbitrary structure as
input and reports a vector of its atomic elements in row-major order.
Lispians call this flattening the structure, but APLers call it “ravel”
because of the metaphor of pulling on a ball of yarn, so what they
really mean is “unravel.” (But the snarky sound of that is uncalled-for,
because a more advanced version that we might implement someday is more
like raveling.) One APL idiom is to apply this to a scalar in order to
turn it into a one-element vector, but we can’t use it that way because
you can’t type a scalar value into the List-type input slot. Equivalent
to the primitive flatten of block.</p>

height=”0.5833333333333334in”}Catenate is like our primitive append,
with two differences: First, if either input is a scalar, it is treated
like a one-item vector. Second, if the two inputs are of different rank,
the catenate function is recursively mapped over the higher-rank input:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1275.png" alt="" />{width=”0.5333333333333333in”
height=”0.25in”}Catenate vertically is similar, but it adds new rows
instead of adding new columns.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1276.png" alt="" />{width=”6.341666666666667in”
height=”1.0416666666666667in”}Integers (I think that’s what it stands
for, although APLers just say “iota”) takes a positive integer input and
reports a vector of the integers from 1 to the input. This is an example
of a function classed as “mixed” not because of its domain but because
of its range. The difference between this block and the primitive
numbers from block is in its treatment of lists as inputs. Numbers from
is a hyperblock, applying itself to each item of its input list:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1277.png" alt="" />{width=”6.025in”
height=”0.8333333333333334in”}Iota has a special meaning for list
inputs: The input must be a shape vector; the result is an array with
that shape in which each item is a list of the indices of the cell along
each dimension. A picture is worth 10^3^ words, but Snap<em>!</em> isn’t so
good at displaying arrays with more than two dimensions, so here we
reduce each cell’s index list to a string:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1278.png" alt="" />{width=”1.475in”
height=”0.25in”}</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1279.png" alt="" />{width=”5.95in”
height=”1.1in”}Dyadic iota is like the index of primitive except for its
handling of multi-dimensional arrays. It looks only for atomic elements,
so a vector in the second input doesn’t mean to search for that vector
as a row of a matrix, which is what it means to index of, but rather to
look separately for each item of the vector, and report a list of the
locations of each item. If the first input is a multi-dimensional array,
then the location of an item is a vector with the indices along each
row.</p>

<p>In this example, the 4 is in the second row, second column. (This is
actually an extension of APL iota, which is more like a hyperized index
of.) Generalizing, if the rank of the second input is less than the rank
of the first input by two or more, then iota looks for the entire second
input in the first input. The reported position is a vector
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1280.png" alt="" />{width=”5.841666666666667in”
height=”0.35in”}whose length is equal to the difference between the two
ranks. If the rank of the second input is one less than the rank of the
first, the reported value is a scalar, the index of the entire second
input in the first.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1281.png" alt="" />{width=”5.383333333333334in”

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1282.png" alt="" />{width=”5.375in”
height=”3.2416666666666667in”}Why the strange design decision to report
length+1 when something isn’t found, instead of a more obvious flag
value such as 0 or false? Here’s why:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1286.png" alt="" />{width=”2.175in”
height=”0.225in”}Note that code has 27 items, not 26. The asterisk at
the end is the ciphertext is the translation of all non-alphabet
characters (spaces and the apostrophe in “doesn’t”). This is a silly
example, because it makes up a random cipher every time it’s called, and
it doesn’t report the cipher, so the recipient can’t decipher the
message. And you wouldn’t want to make the spaces in the message so
obvious. But despite being silly, the example shows the benefit of
reporting length+1 as the position of items not found.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1287.png" alt="" />{width=”7.485416666666667in”
height=”0.6597222222222222in”}The contained in block is like a hyperized
contains with the input order reversed. It reports an array of Booleans
the same shape as the left input. The shape of the right input doesn’t
matter; the block looks only for atomic elements.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1288.png" alt="" />{width=”2.6645833333333333in”
height=”0.31666666666666665in”}The blocks grade up and grade down are
used for sorting data. Given an array as input, it reports a vector of
the indices in which the items (the rows, if a matrix) should be
rearranged in order to be sorted. This will be
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1292.png" alt="" />{width=”7.4944444444444445in”
height=”1.8069444444444445in”}clearer with an example:</p>

<p>The result from grade up tells us that item 3 of <strong>foo</strong> comes first in
sorted order, then item 4, then 2, then 1. When we actually select items
of <strong>foo</strong> based on this ordering, we get the desired sorted version.
The result reported by grade down is almost the reverse of that from
grade up, but not quite, if there are equal items in the list. (The sort
is stable, so if there are equal items, then whichever comes first in
the input list will also be first in the sorted list.)</p>

<p>Why this two-step process? Why not just have a sort primitive in APL?
One answer is that in a database application you might want to sort one
array based on the order of another array:</p>

<p>This is the list of employees of a small company. (Taken from <em>Structure
and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> by Abelson and Sussman.
Creative Commons licensed.) Each of the smaller lists contains a
person's name, job title, and yearly salary.
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1298.png" alt="" />{width=”5.483333333333333in”
height=”2.2in”}We would like to sort the employees’ names in
big-to-small order of salary. First we extract column 3 of the database,
the salaries:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1299.png" alt="" />{width=”3.5590277777777777in”
height=”1.976388888888889in”}<br />
Then we use grade down to get the reordering indices:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1300.png" alt="" />{width=”5.333333333333333in”
height=”2.3733333333333335in”}<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1301.png" alt="" />{width=”4.978472222222222in”
height=”2.2333333333333334in”}At this point we <em>could</em> use the index
vector to sort the salaries:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1302.png" alt="" />{width=”5.593333333333334in”
height=”2.3in”}But what we actually want is a list of <em>names,</em> sorted by
salary:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1303.png" alt="" />{width=”2.308333333333333in”

height=”0.325in”}By taking the index vector from grade down of column 3
and telling item to apply it to column 1, we get what we set out to
find. As usual the code is more elegant in APL:
database[⍒database[;3];1].</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1305.png" alt="" />{width=”2.9472222222222224in”
height=”0.22569444444444445in”}In case you’ve forgotten, or would select
the third <em>row</em> of the database; we need the list 3 in the second input
slot of the outer list to select by columns rather than by rows.</p>

<p>Select (if take) or select all but (if drop) the first (if <em>n</em>&gt;0) or
last (if <em>n</em>&lt;0) |<em>n</em>| items from a vector, or rows from a matrix.
Alternatively, if the left input is a two-item vector, select rows with
the first item and columns with the second.</p>

<p>The compress block selects a subset of its right input based on the
Boolean values in its left input, which must be a vector of Booleans
whose length equals the length of the array (the number of rows, for a
matrix) in the right input. The block reports an array of the same rank
as the right input, but containing only those rows whose corresponding
Boolean value is true. The columns version <strong>⌿</strong> is the same but
selecting columns rather than selecting rows.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1309.png" alt="" />{width=”6.452083333333333in”
height=”0.25in”}A word about the possibly confusing names of these
blocks: There are two ways to think about what they do. Take the
standard / version, to avoid talking about both at once. One way to
think about it is that it selects some of the rows. The other way is
that it shortens the columns. For Lispians, which includes you since
you’ve learned about keep, the natural way to think about / is that it
keeps some of the rows. Since we represent a matrix as a list of rows,
that also fits with how this function is implemented. (Read the code;
you’ll find a keep inside.) But APL people think about it the other way,
so when you read APL documentation, / is described as operating on the
last dimension (the columns), while <strong>⌿</strong> is described as operating on
rows. We were more than a month into this project before I understood
all this. You get long block names so it won’t take you a month!</p>

height=”0.23333333333333334in”}Don’t confuse this block with the reduce
block, whose APL symbol is also a slash. In that block, what comes to
the left of the slash is a dyadic combining function; it’s the APL
equivalent of combine. This block is more nearly equivalent to keep. But
keep takes a predicate function as input, and calls the function for
each item of the second input. With compress, the predicate function, if
any, has already been called on all the items of the right input in
parallel, resulting in a vector of Boolean values. This is a typical APL
move; since hyperblocks are equivalent to an implicit map, it’s easy to
make the vector of Booleans, because any scalar function, including
predicates, can be applied to a list instead of to a scalar. The reason
both blocks use the / character is that both of them reduce the size of
the input array, although in different ways.</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1316.png" alt="" />{width=”5.875in”
height=”2.9944444444444445in”}The reverse row order, reverse column
order, and transpose blocks form a group: the group of reflections of a
matrix. The APL symbols are all a circle with a line through it; the
lines are the different axes of reflection. So the reverse row order
block reverses which row is where; the reverse column order block
reverses which column is where; and the transpose block turns rows into
columns and vice versa:</p>

<p>Except for reverse row order, these work only on full arrays, not
ragged-right lists of lists, because the result of the other two would
be an array in which some rows had “holes”: items 1 and 3 exist, but not
item 2. We don’t have a representation for that. (In APL, all arrays are
full, so it’s even more restrictive.)</p>

<h3 id="higher-order-functions">Higher order functions</h3>

<p>The final category of function is operators—APL higher order
functions. APL has no explicit map function, because the hyperblock
capability serves much the same need. But APL2 did add an explicit map,
which we might get around to adding to the library next time around. Its
symbol is <strong>¨</strong> (diaeresis or umlaut).</p>

<p>The APL equivalent of keep is compress, but it’s not a higher order
function. You create a vector of Booleans (0s and 1s, in APL) before
applying the function to the array you want to compress.</p>

height=”0.6131944444444445in”}But APL does have a higher order version
of combine:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1326.png" alt="" />{width=”6.683333333333334in”
height=”1.0416666666666667in”}The reduce block works just like combine,
taking a dyadic function and a list. The / version translates each row
to a single value; the <strong>⌿</strong> version translates each column to a single
value. That’s the only way to think about it from the perspective of
combining individual elements: you are adding up, or whatever the
function is, the numbers in a single row (/) or in a single column
(<strong>⌿</strong>). But APLers think of a matrix as made up of vectors, either row
vectors or column vectors. And if you think of what these blocks do as
adding vectors, rather than adding individual numbers, it’s clear that
in</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1328.png" alt="" />{width=”4.808333333333334in”
height=”1.1in”}the <em>vector</em> (10, 26, 42) is the sum of <em>column vectors</em>
(1, 5, 9)+(2, 6, 10)+(3, 7, 11)+(4, 8, 12). In pre-6.0 Snap<em>!</em>, we’d get
the same result this way:</p>

<p>mapping over the <em>rows</em> of the matrix, applying combine to each row.
Combining rows, reducing column vectors.<br />
The outer product block takes two arrays (vectors, typically) and a
dyadic scalar function as inputs. It reports an array whose rank is the
sum of the ranks of the inputs (so, typically a matrix), in which each
item is the result of applying the function to an atomic element of each
array. The third element of the second row of the result is the value
reported by the function with the second element of the left input and
the third element of the right input. (The APL symbol ◦. is pronounced
“jot dot.”) The way to think about this block is “multiplication table”
from elementary school:</p>

height=”1.0069444444444444in”}The inner product block takes two matrices
and two operations as input. The number of columns in the left matrix
must equal the number of rows in the right matrix. When the two
operations are + and ×, this is the matrix multiplication familiar to
mathematicians:</p>

<p>But other operations can be used. One common inner product is ∨.∧ (“or
dot and”) applied to Boolean matrices, to find rows and columns that
have corresponding items in common.</p>

height=”0.18333333333333332in”}The printable block isn’t an APL
function; it’s an aid to exploring APL-in-Snap<em>!</em>. It transforms arrays
to a compact representation that still makes the structure clear:</p>

<p><img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1334.png" alt="" />{width=”5.997916666666667in”
height=”0.3333333333333333in”}Experts will recognize this as the Lisp
representation of list structure,</p>

      <p>One of the hat blocks, the generic “when anything” block , is
subtly different from the others. When the stop sign is clicked, or
when a project or sprite is loaded, this block doesn’t test whether
the condition in its hexagonal input slot is true, so the script
beneath it will not run, until some <em>other</em> script in the project
runs (because, for example, you click the green flag). When generic
when blocks are disabled, the stop sign will be square instead of
octagonal. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>The hide variable and show variable blocks can also be used to
hide and show primitives in the palette. The pulldown menu doesn’t
include primitive blocks, but there’s a generally useful technique
to give a block input values it wasn’t expecting using run or
call:<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image120.png" alt="" />{width=”3.9375in”
height=”0.3888888888888889in”}</p>

      <p>In order to use a block as an input this way, you must explicitly
put a ring around it, by right-clicking on it and choosing ringify.
More about rings in Chapter VI. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Note to users of earlier versions: From the beginning, there has
been a tension in our work between the desire to provide tools such
as for (used in this example) and the higher order functions
introduced on the next page as primitives, to be used as easily as
other primitives, and the desire to show how readily such tools can
be implemented in Snap<em>!</em> itself. This is one instance of our
general pedagogic understanding that learners should both use
abstractions and be permitted to see beneath the abstraction
barrier. Until version 5.0, we used the uneasy compromise of a
library of tools written in Snap<em>!</em> and easily, but not easily
enough, loaded into a project. By <em>not</em> loading the tools, users or
teachers could explore how to program them. In 5.0 we made them true
primitives, partly because that’s what some of us wanted all along
and partly because of the increasing importance of fast performance
as we explore “big data” and media computation. But this is not the
end of the story for us. In a later version, after we get the design
firmed up, we intend to introduce “hybrid” primitives, implemented
in high speed Javascript but with an “Edit” option that will open,
not the primitive implementation, but the version written in
Snap<em>!</em>. The trick is to ensure that this can be done without
dramatically slowing users’ projects. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>In Scratch, every block that takes a Text-type input has a default
value that makes the rectangles for text wider than tall. The blocks
that aren’t specifically about text either are of Number type or
have no default value, so those rectangles are taller than wide. At
ﬁrst some of us (bh) thought that Text was a separate type that
always had a wide input slot; it turns out that this isn’t true in
Scratch (delete the default text and the rectangle narrows), but we
thought it a good idea anyway, so we allow Text-shaped boxes even
for empty input slots. (This is why Text comes just above Any in the
input type selection box.) <a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>There is a primitive id function in the menu of the sqrt of block,

example easier to understand. <a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Some languages popular in the “real world” today, such as
JavaScript, claim to use prototyping, but their object system is
much more complicated than what we are describing (we’re guessing
it’s because they were designed by people too familiar with
class/instance programming); that has, in some circles, given
prototyping a bad name. Our prototyping design comes from Object
Logo, and before that, from Henry Lieberman. [Lieberman, H., Using
Prototypical Objects to Implement Shared Behavior in Object-Oriented
Systems, First Conference on Object-Oriented Programming Languages,
Systems, and Applications [OOPSLA-86], ACM SigCHI, Portland, OR,
September, 1986. Also in <em>Object-Oriented Computing,</em> Gerald
