variable in the Variables palette or with the show variable block, and
do all the other things you can generally do, including modifying the
paused scripts by adding or removing blocks. The button changes shape to
and clicking it again resumes the paused scripts.

### Breakpoints: the pause all block

The pause button is great if your program
seems to be in an infinite loop, but more often you'll want to set a
*breakpoint,* a particular point in a script at which you want to pause.
The block, near the bottom of the Control palette, can be inserted in a
script to pause when it is run. So, for example, if your program is
getting an error message in a particular block, you could use pause all
just before that block to look at the values of variables just before
the error happens.

The pause all block turns bright cyan
while paused. Also, during the pause, you can right-click on a running
script and the menu that appears will give you the option to show
watchers for temporary variables of the script:

But what if the block with the error is run many times in a loop, and it
only errors when a particular condition is true---say, the value of some
variable is negative, which shouldn't ever happen. In the iteration
library (see page 25 for more about how to use libraries) is a
breakpoint block that lets you set a *conditional* breakpoint, and
automatically display the relevant variables before pausing. Here's a
sample use of it:

(In this contrived example, variable zot
comes from outside the script but is relevant to its behavior.) When you
continue (with the pause button), the temporary variable watchers are
removed by this breakpoint block before resuming the script. The
breakpoint block isn't magic; you could alternatively just put a pause
all inside an if.[^2]

### Visible stepping

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image123.png" style="width:28px; height:16px">
Sometimes you're not exactly sure where
the error is, or you don't understand how the program got there. To
understand better, you'd like to watch the program as it runs, at human
speed rather than at computer speed. You can do this by clicking the
*visible stepping button* ( ), before running a script or while the
script is paused. The button will light up ( ) and a speed control
slider will appear in the toolbar. When you start or continue the
script, its blocks and input slots will light up cyan one at a time:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image124.png" style="width:720px; height:110px">
In this simple example, the inputs to the blocks are
constant values, but if an input were a more complicated expression
involving several reporter blocks, each of those would light up as they
are called. Note that the input to a block is evaluated before the block
itself is called, so, for example, the 100 lights up before the move.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image134.png" style="width:28px; height:16px">
The speed of stepping is controlled by
the slider. If you move the slider all the way to the left, the speed is
zero, the pause button turns into a step button , and the script takes a
single step each time you push it. The name for this is *single
stepping.*

If several scripts that are visible in the scripting area are running at
the same time, all of them are stepped in parallel. However, consider
the case of two repeat loops with different numbers of blocks. While not
stepping, each script goes through a complete cycle of its loop in each
display cycle, despite the difference in the length of a cycle. In order
to ensure that the visible result of a program on the stage is the same
when stepped as when not stepped, the shorter script will wait at the
bottom of its loop for the longer script to catch up.

When we talk about custom blocks in Chapter III, we'll have more to say
about visible stepping as it affects those blocks.
