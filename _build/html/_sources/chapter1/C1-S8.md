then the Variables palette will look like this:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image99.png" style="width:100px; height:39px">
There's now a "Delete a variable" button, and there's
an orange oval with the variable name in it, just like the orange oval
in the for block. You can drag the variable into any script in the
scripting area. Next to the oval is a checkbox, initially checked. When
it's checked, you'll also see a *variable watcher* on the stage:

When you give the variable a value, the orange box in its watcher will
display the value.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image100.png" style="width:185px; height:46px">
How *do* you give it a value? You use the
set block:

Note that you *don't* drag the variable's oval into the set block! You
click on the downarrow in the first input slot, and you get a menu of
all the available variable names.

If you do choose "For this sprite only" when creating a variable, its
block in the palette looks like this:

![Macintosh
HD:Users:bh:Desktop:local-var.png](image101.png){width="0.6583333333333333in" height="0.14166666666666666in"}
 The *location*-pin icon is a bit of a
pun on a sprite-*local* variable. It's shown only in the palette.
