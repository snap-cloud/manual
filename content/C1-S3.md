# Reporter Blocks and Expressions

So far, we've used two kinds of blocks: hat blocks and command blocks. Another kind is the *reporter* block, which has an oval shape: <img src="/content/assets/images/image66.png" style="width:70px; height:15px">. It's called a "reporter" because when it's run, instead of carrying out an action, it reports a value that can be used as an input to another block. If you drag a reporter into the scripting area by itself and click on it, the value it reports will appear in a speech balloon next to the block:

<img src="/content/assets/images/image65.png" style="width:141px; height:50px">

When you drag a reporter block over another block's input slot, a white "halo" appears around that input slot, analogous to the white line that appears when snapping command blocks together:

<img src="/content/assets/images/image67.png" style="width:520px; height:92px">


Don't drop the input over a *red* halo:
<img src="/content/assets/images/image71.png" style="width:203px; height:59px">

That's used for a purpose explained on page 68.

Here's a simple script that uses a reporter block:

<img src="/content/assets/images/image73.png" style="width:520px; height:131px">

Here the x position reporter provides the first input to the say block. (The sprite's X position is its horizontal position, how far left (negative values) or right (positive values) it is compared to the center of the stage. Similarly, the Y position is measured vertically, in steps above (positive) or below (negative) the center.)

You can do arithmetic using reporters in the Operators palette:

<img src="/content/assets/images/image76.png" style="width:601px; height:139px">

The round block rounds 35.3905... to 35, and the + block adds 100 to that. (By the way, the round block is in the Operators palette, just like +, but in this script it's a lighter color with black lettering because Snap<em>!</em> alternates light and dark versions of the palette colors when a block is nested inside another block from the same palette:

<img src="/content/assets/images/image80.png" style="width:466px; height:183px">

This aid to readability is called *zebra coloring.*) A reporter block with its inputs, maybe including other reporter blocks, such as <img src="/content/assets/images/image81.png" style="width:184px; height:23px">, is called an *expression.*
