So far, we've used two kinds of blocks: hat blocks
and command blocks. Another kind is the *reporter* block, which has an
oval shape: . It's called a "reporter" because when it's run, instead of
carrying out an action, it reports a value that can be used as an input
to another block. If you drag a reporter into the scripting area by
itself and click on it, the value it reports will appear in a speech
balloon next to the block:

When you drag a reporter block over
another block's input slot, a white "halo" appears around that input
slot, analogous to the white line that appears when snapping command
blocks together:

Don't drop the input over a *red* halo:

That's used for a purpose explained on page 68.

Here's a simple script that uses a reporter block:

Here the x position reporter provides the
first input to the say block. (The sprite's X position is its horizontal
position, how far left (negative values) or right (positive values) it
is compared to the center of the stage. Similarly, the Y position is
measured vertically, in steps above (positive) or below (negative) the
center.)

You can do arithmetic using reporters in the Operators palette:

The round block rounds 35.3905... to 35,
and the + block adds 100 to that. (By the way, the round block is in the
Operators palette, just like +, but in this script it's a lighter color
with black lettering because Snap*!* alternates light and dark versions
of the palette colors when a block is nested inside another block from
the same palette:

This aid to readability is called *zebra
coloring.*) A reporter block with its inputs, maybe including other
reporter blocks, such as , is called an *expression.*
